[Introduction to Meraki MG]

Presenter: The Meraki MG is a cloud-managed communication gateway that brings simplicity and intelligence to your network. It's designed to optimize voice and data traffic, and provide secure connectivity for remote sites.

[Use case 1: VoIP optimization]

Presenter: Imagine you're a Professional Services firm with multiple office locations and a centralized VoIP system. With the Meraki MG, you can ensure high-quality voice calls by prioritizing VoIP traffic over other data traffic. This improves call clarity and reduces dropped calls, leading to better client communication and higher productivity.

**click 'Configure > Traffic shaping'**

Presenter: Here, you can set up traffic shaping rules to give priority to VoIP traffic. This ensures that your client calls are always crystal clear, even during peak network usage.

[Use case 2: Remote site connectivity]

Presenter: As a Professional Services firm, you may have consultants working remotely or at client sites. The Meraki MG makes it easy to establish secure VPN connections to these remote sites, ensuring seamless access to your internal resources.

**click 'Configure > VPN'**

Presenter: With just a few clicks, you can create VPN tunnels to remote sites, encrypting all traffic for enhanced security. This enables your consultants to collaborate effectively and access critical data securely, no matter where they are located.

[Use case 3: Network security]

Presenter: Network security is paramount for Professional Services firms, as they often handle sensitive client data. The Meraki MG includes built-in security features such as stateful firewall and intrusion prevention, protecting your network from cyber threats.

**click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN'**

Presenter: Here, you can configure firewall rules to allow or block specific traffic, as well as enable intrusion prevention to detect and block suspicious activity. This gives you peace of mind that your network is secure and your client data is protected.

[Smart questions for discussion]

Presenter: Now, I'd like to ask you a couple of smart questions to prompt discussion:
1. How do you currently prioritize voice traffic on your network, and what challenges do you face in ensuring call quality?
2. What measures do you have in place to secure your network and protect client data, especially for remote workers?

[Closing]

Presenter: Thank you for your time today. I hope this demo has given you a clear understanding of how the Meraki MG can benefit your Professional Services firm. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss a customized solution, please feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
