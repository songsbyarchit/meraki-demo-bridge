Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for a demo of Meraki MR specifically tailored for the Professional Services sector. Today, we will be focusing on how Meraki MR can help improve your operations and justify its cost through its powerful features. 

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility and Control]

Presenter: Let's start with a common use case in the Professional Services sector - network visibility and control. With Meraki MR, you can easily monitor and manage your network from a central dashboard. **Click 'Configure > Wireless > Access Control'** to see all the devices connected to your network in real-time. This level of visibility allows you to identify potential issues before they impact your operations.

[Use Case 2: Seamless Guest Wi-Fi]

Presenter: Another key feature of Meraki MR is its ability to provide seamless guest Wi-Fi access. **Click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** to set up a separate guest network with a simple splash page for easy onboarding. This not only enhances the experience for your clients but also ensures that your internal network remains secure.

[Use Case 3: Location Analytics]

Presenter: Lastly, let's talk about location analytics. With Meraki MR, you can track the movement of devices within your network and gain valuable insights into foot traffic patterns. **Click 'Monitor > Location Analytics'** to see real-time data on device locations. This information can help you optimize your space and improve the overall customer experience.

[Smart Questions]

Presenter: Now, I have a couple of questions for you to prompt discussion:
1. How important is network reliability and security for your operations?
2. Have you faced any challenges with managing guest Wi-Fi access in the past?
3. How do you currently track and analyze customer foot traffic in your physical locations?
