Presenter: Hello and thank you for joining us today for our Meraki MX demo. We understand that as IT professionals in the Professional Services sector, you are constantly looking for ways to improve operational efficiency and justify costs. Today, we'll be showing you how the Meraki MX can help you achieve those goals.

Let's start by looking at one of the key features of the Meraki MX - the ability to easily configure and manage network security. With the Meraki dashboard, you can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Addressing & VLANs'** to set up VLANs and firewall rules in just a few clicks. This simplifies the process of securing your network and ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.

Another use case that is particularly relevant to the Professional Services sector is remote access. With the Meraki MX, you can easily set up secure VPN connections for your remote employees. Simply **click 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN'** to configure VPN settings and provide secure access to your network from anywhere in the world. This not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances security by ensuring that remote employees are accessing the network securely.

Now, let's talk about cost justification. The Meraki MX offers a cloud-managed solution that eliminates the need for expensive on-premises hardware and IT resources. This not only reduces upfront costs but also lowers ongoing maintenance costs. Additionally, the centralized management capabilities of the Meraki dashboard allow you to monitor and troubleshoot network issues remotely, reducing the need for on-site IT support.
