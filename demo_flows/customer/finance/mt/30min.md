Presenter: Hello and welcome to our Meraki MT demo targeted towards the Finance sector. Today, we'll be discussing how Meraki MT can help streamline your network operations and provide cost-effective solutions for your organization. 

Let's start with a common use case in the Finance sector - ensuring network security and compliance. With Meraki MT, you can easily set up security policies and monitor network activity in real-time. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security policies'**. This allows you to quickly identify and mitigate any security threats, ensuring the safety of your sensitive financial data.

Another key use case for Meraki MT in the Finance sector is network scalability. As your organization grows, you need a network solution that can scale with you. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'**. With Meraki MT, you can easily add new devices to your network, without the need for complex configurations or additional hardware. This not only saves you time and resources but also ensures seamless network operations.

Now, let's talk about cost justification. Meraki MT offers a cloud-based management platform that eliminates the need for expensive on-premise hardware and IT resources. **Click 'Dashboard > Licensing'**. By moving to a cloud-based solution, you can significantly reduce your operational costs while still maintaining a high level of network performance and security.
