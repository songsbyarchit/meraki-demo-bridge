Hello and welcome to our Meraki MG demo tailored specifically for the Finance sector. Today, we will explore how the Meraki MG can streamline your network operations and help you achieve cost savings.

Let's start by looking at the operational impact of the Meraki MG. As an IT admin or financial decision maker, you understand the importance of a reliable and efficient network. With the Meraki MG, you can easily monitor and manage your network infrastructure from a single dashboard, saving you time and resources.

**Click 'Dashboard' to see an overview of your network status.** Here, you can quickly identify any issues and take action to resolve them, ensuring minimal downtime for your finance operations.

Now, let's dive into a use case for the Meraki MG in the Finance sector. Imagine you have multiple branch offices spread across different locations. With the Meraki MG, you can easily deploy and manage VPN connections to securely connect all your branches to your central network. This not only ensures data security but also improves communication and collaboration among your teams.

**Click 'Configure > VPN' to set up VPN connections for your branch offices.** Here, you can configure the settings and monitor the performance of your VPN connections in real-time.

Another use case for the Meraki MG in the Finance sector is network segmentation. As a financial institution, you deal with sensitive customer data that requires strict access controls. With the Meraki MG, you can easily create separate network segments for different departments or user groups, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information.

**Click 'Configure > Switch ports' to set up network segmentation for your finance department.** Here, you can define access policies and monitor network traffic to detect any suspicious activity.

Now, let's wrap up this demo with a few smart questions for you to consider:

1. How much time and resources are currently spent on managing your network infrastructure?
2. What are the key security challenges you face in your finance operations, and how can the Meraki MG help address them?
3. Have you considered the potential cost savings and operational efficiencies that the Meraki MG can bring to your organization?
