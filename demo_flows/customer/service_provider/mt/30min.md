[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MT demo today. I'm excited to show you how our solution can benefit your service provider business. Whether you're an IT admin overseeing network operations or a financial decision maker looking for cost-effective solutions, Meraki MT has something to offer. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Network Automation]

Let's start with one of the key features of Meraki MT - network automation. As a service provider, you know the importance of efficient network management. With Meraki MT, you can automate repetitive tasks and streamline your network operations. For example, you can easily **click 'Configure > Switch Ports'** to set up automated port configurations based on predefined policies. This not only saves time but also reduces the chance of human error, ultimately improving network reliability.

[Use Case 2: Security and Compliance]

Security and compliance are top priorities for service providers. With Meraki MT, you can ensure that your network meets industry standards and regulations. For instance, you can **click 'Security > Access Control'** to set up role-based access control and monitor network activity in real-time. This not only enhances security but also helps you demonstrate compliance to your customers.

[Use Case 3: Scalability and Cost Efficiency]

As a service provider, scalability and cost efficiency are crucial factors to consider. With Meraki MT, you can easily scale your network infrastructure as your business grows. Our cloud-based management platform allows you to **click 'Devices > Add Devices'** to seamlessly add new devices to your network. This scalability not only reduces upfront costs but also ensures that you're only paying for what you need.

1. How do you currently manage network operations in your service provider business?
2. What are the key challenges you face in terms of network security and compliance?
3. How do you see Meraki MT fitting into your long-term network infrastructure strategy?
