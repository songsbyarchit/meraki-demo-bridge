[Opening]

Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for our Meraki SM demo tailored for Service Providers. I understand that many of you are IT admins or financial decision makers, so today we'll be focusing on the operational impact and cost justification of using Meraki SM. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Device Management]

Presenter: One of the key features of Meraki SM is device management. With Meraki SM, you can easily enroll devices, push policies and apps, and troubleshoot issues remotely. Let me show you how easy it is to enroll a device. **click 'Systems Manager > Add devices'**

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]

Presenter: Another important use case for Service Providers is security compliance. Meraki SM allows you to enforce security policies on devices, such as requiring encryption or setting up VPNs. This helps ensure that your clients' data is secure. Let me show you how to set up security policies. **click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'**

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]

Presenter: Remote troubleshooting is a time-saving feature of Meraki SM. Instead of having to physically go to a client's location to fix an issue, you can troubleshoot remotely. This reduces downtime and improves efficiency. Let's take a look at the remote troubleshooting tools. **click 'Systems Manager > Remote Tools'**

[Use Case 4: Inventory Management]

Presenter: Inventory management is crucial for Service Providers to keep track of all devices and licenses. Meraki SM provides detailed inventory reports and alerts for when devices need updates or replacements. Let me show you how to generate an inventory report. **click 'Systems Manager > Inventory'**

[Smart Questions]

Presenter: Now that we've covered some key use cases, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. How do you currently manage device security and compliance for your clients? And, are you experiencing any challenges with remote troubleshooting and device inventory?

[Closing]
