[Opening]

Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki SM demo specifically tailored for Service Providers. My name is [Presenter] and I'll be walking you through the features and benefits of Meraki SM and how it can positively impact your operations and costs.

[Slide 1: Introduction to Meraki SM]
Presenter: Let's start by discussing what Meraki SM is and how it can benefit your organization. Meraki SM is a cloud-based mobile device management solution that allows you to easily manage and secure all your devices from a single dashboard. This includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even IoT devices.

[Slide 2: Use Case 1 - Device Onboarding]
Presenter: One common use case for Service Providers is device onboarding. Imagine having to provision hundreds of devices for your customers. With Meraki SM, you can easily onboard devices by **clicking 'Systems Manager > Add New Device'**. This saves you time and ensures a consistent setup for all your customers.

[Slide 3: Use Case 2 - Security and Compliance]
Presenter: Security and compliance are crucial for Service Providers. With Meraki SM, you can enforce security policies across all devices, such as requiring passcodes, encrypting data, and even remotely wiping devices in case of loss or theft. This helps you stay compliant with regulations and protect sensitive customer data.

[Slide 4: Cost Justification]
Presenter: Now, let's talk about the cost justification for implementing Meraki SM. By streamlining device management and reducing the risk of security breaches, you can save time and money in the long run. Additionally, the cloud-based nature of Meraki SM eliminates the need for expensive on-premise solutions and reduces maintenance costs.

[Slide 5: Smart Questions]
Presenter: Before we wrap up, I'd like to ask you a couple of smart questions to prompt discussion. How do you currently manage device onboarding for your customers? And what are the biggest challenges you face in terms of device security and compliance?
