As a service provider, it's crucial to prioritize network traffic based on customer needs. With Meraki MX, you can **click 'Configure > Traffic shaping'** to set up Quality of Service (QoS) policies that guarantee the highest level of service for critical applications. This not only enhances user experience but also allows you to optimize network resources efficiently.

Use Case 3: Threat Protection and Intrusion Prevention
