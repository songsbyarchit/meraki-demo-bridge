[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Management]

Let's start with a common use case in the hospitality industry - guest Wi-Fi management. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up a secure guest Wi-Fi network with just a few clicks. **Navigate to 'Wireless > SSIDs'** and you can create a separate SSID for your guests with limited bandwidth and access controls. This not only enhances the guest experience but also ensures the security of your internal network.

[Use Case 2: Content Filtering and Security]

Next, let's talk about content filtering and security. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up web filtering policies to block malicious websites and ensure compliance with industry regulations. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Content Filtering'** and you can create custom policies based on categories or specific URLs to protect your network from threats. This not only enhances security but also improves operational efficiency by reducing the risk of cyber attacks.

[Use Case 3: VPN and Remote Access]

Lastly, let's discuss VPN and remote access capabilities. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up secure VPN tunnels for remote employees or branch offices. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN'** and you can configure site-to-site VPNs or client VPNs with just a few simple steps. This not only enables seamless collaboration but also reduces the need for expensive dedicated connections, saving costs for your business.
