Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, this demo will show you the operational impact and cost justification of implementing the Meraki MX in your hospitality environment.

[Use Case 1: Network Security]

Let's start with one of the most critical aspects for any hospitality business - network security. With the Meraki MX, you can easily set up firewall rules to protect your network from cyber threats. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to see how you can create rules to block malicious traffic and prevent data breaches.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Management]

Next, let's talk about guest Wi-Fi management. The Meraki MX allows you to create a separate SSID for guests and set bandwidth limits to ensure a smooth experience for your customers. **Click 'Wireless > SSID'** to see how you can configure a guest network with just a few clicks.

[Use Case 3: VPN Configuration]

For hospitality businesses with multiple locations, setting up a VPN can be a complex and time-consuming task. With the Meraki MX, you can easily create site-to-site VPNs to securely connect your different locations. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-Site VPN'** to see how simple it is to establish a secure connection between your properties.

[Use Case 4: Application Visibility]

Understanding your network traffic is key to optimizing performance and ensuring a seamless experience for your guests. With the Meraki MX, you can easily view application usage and prioritize mission-critical applications. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Performance'** to see real-time insights into your network traffic.
