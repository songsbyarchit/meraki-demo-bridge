Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo of Cisco Meraki MG. 

I see you're in the Hospitality sector, so I'm excited to show you how our MG solution can address your specific needs. Before we dive in, could you tell me a bit about your current network setup and where you're facing the biggest IT challenges? 

Great, let's jump into it. One key use case for MG in the Hospitality sector is ensuring seamless guest Wi-Fi connectivity. With MG, you can **create a new SSID** specifically for guests, set up **splash pages** for branding and user information capture, and easily **monitor bandwidth usage** to ensure a great experience for all guests. 

Another important feature for Hospitality is **network segmentation**. By **creating VLANs** for different areas like guest rooms, lobby, and back office, you can ensure security and compliance while still providing a seamless experience for guests and staff. 

Now, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard. Here, you can see all your MG devices in one place, get **real-time network insights**, and **remotely troubleshoot** any issues that arise. Let's **navigate to the Wireless tab** to see the different SSIDs and **check client connectivity**. 

Moving on, let's explore **network segmentation** in more detail. By **creating a new VLAN** for the guest Wi-Fi network, you can easily **apply firewall rules** to restrict access and ensure security. 

Now, let's wrap up with some common questions you might have about MG in the Hospitality sector:

Q: Can we integrate this with our existing systems and security policies?
