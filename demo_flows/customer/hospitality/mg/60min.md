[Use Case 1: Bandwidth Management]
Imagine a busy hotel lobby with guests streaming videos and using social media.

This ensures a seamless experience for all guests without impacting your operational efficiency. To set this up, simply **click 'Configure > Traffic shaping'** in the dashboard.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Management]
Managing guest Wi-Fi can be a headache, especially during peak hours. With the Meraki MG, you can create custom splash pages, limit bandwidth for each user, and even track usage statistics in real-time. This not only enhances the guest experience but also allows you to optimize your network resources efficiently. To access these features, **click 'Configure > Splash pages'** in the dashboard.

[Use Case 3: Security Monitoring]
Security is a top priority in the Hospitality sector. The Meraki MG offers advanced security features such as deep packet inspection and threat intelligence, allowing you to detect and mitigate potential threats before they impact your network. With a few **clicks in the dashboard**, you can set up alerts and monitor security incidents in real-time.

[Use Case 4: Network Performance Optimization]
In a hotel environment, network performance is crucial for delivering a seamless guest experience. With the Meraki MG, you can easily monitor network traffic, identify bottlenecks, and optimize performance with built-in analytics tools. By analyzing data trends and making adjustments in real-time, you can ensure high-speed connectivity for both guests and staff.
