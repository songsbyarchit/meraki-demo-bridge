Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Management
Presenter: One of the key challenges in the Hospitality sector is managing guest Wi-Fi access securely and efficiently. With Meraki MS, you can easily set up different SSIDs for guests, staff, and administrators, each with its own access controls and bandwidth limits. **Let's navigate to 'Wireless > SSIDs' to demonstrate how easy it is to configure and manage these settings.**

Use Case 2: Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting
Presenter: Another common issue in the Hospitality sector is ensuring network uptime and quickly resolving any issues that arise. With Meraki MS, you have real-time visibility into your network, including device status, traffic patterns, and application usage. **Let's explore the 'Monitor > Network-wide > Clients' dashboard to see how you can easily identify and troubleshoot network issues.**

Use Case 3: Automated Network Provisioning
Presenter: Finally, Meraki MS offers automated network provisioning, making it easy to deploy and scale your network infrastructure. With zero-touch provisioning, you can simply plug in a new Meraki switch and it will automatically connect to the cloud, download the necessary configurations, and be ready to use. **Let's simulate this process by plugging in a new switch and observing the automatic provisioning in action.**
