**Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Management**
Imagine being able to easily set up and manage secure guest Wi-Fi access in your hotel or restaurant. With **MS**, you can **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** on the Meraki Dashboard to create custom guest networks with just a few clicks. This not only enhances guest experience but also ensures network security.

**Use Case 2: Network Segmentation for POS Systems**
In a busy hospitality environment, keeping POS systems secure and separate from guest networks is crucial. **MS** allows you to **click 'Switch > VLANs'** on the dashboard to segment your network, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected.

**Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting**
When issues arise at remote sites, the last thing you want is to send IT staff on-site. With **MS**, you can **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to quickly identify and troubleshoot network problems from the central dashboard, saving time and resources.
