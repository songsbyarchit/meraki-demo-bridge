[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Access Management]

Moving on to our second use case, let's talk about guest Wi-Fi access management. In the hospitality sector, providing seamless and secure Wi-Fi access is crucial. With Meraki SM, you can create customized guest Wi-Fi networks, set access policies, and monitor usage in real-time. **Click 'Wireless > SSID'**. By efficiently managing guest Wi-Fi access, you can improve guest satisfaction and potentially increase revenue through additional services.
