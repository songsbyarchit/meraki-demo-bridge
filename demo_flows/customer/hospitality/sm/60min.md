[Opening]

Hello and thank you for joining us today for our Meraki SM demo tailored for the Hospitality sector. Today, we will be focusing on how Meraki SM can help streamline your IT operations and provide cost justification for your organization. 

[Use Case 1: Device Management]

Let's start with device management. With Meraki SM, you can easily manage all your devices from a centralized dashboard. From smartphones to tablets to laptops, you can see all your devices in one place. **Click 'Systems Manager > Manage > Devices'**. This not only saves time for your IT admins but also ensures that all devices are up to date and secure.

[Use Case 2: Network Security]

Next, let's talk about network security. In the hospitality sector, guest Wi-Fi is a must-have. But with Meraki SM, you can easily set up different network policies for guests and employees. **Click 'Configure > Wireless settings'**. This not only enhances security but also ensures a seamless experience for your guests.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]

One of the key features of Meraki SM is remote troubleshooting. With just a few clicks, IT admins can troubleshoot issues on devices remotely. **Click 'Systems Manager > Manage > Devices > Troubleshoot'**. This reduces downtime and improves operational efficiency.

[Use Case 4: Compliance and Reporting]

Compliance is crucial in the hospitality sector. With Meraki SM, you can easily track device compliance and generate reports for audits. **Click 'Systems Manager > Monitor > Compliance'**. This not only ensures that your organization is compliant but also saves time on manual reporting.

[Smart Questions for Discussion]

Now, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently manage device security and compliance in your organization?
2. What are the key pain points you face in IT operations within the hospitality sector?

[Closing]

Thank you for joining us today for our Meraki SM demo. We hope you've seen the operational impact and cost justification that Meraki SM can bring to your organization in the hospitality sector. If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please feel free to reach out.
