Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo on Cisco Meraki tailored for the Hospitality sector. I'm excited to show you how our **MT** product can revolutionize your network management. Before we dive in, let's start with a couple of warm-up questions:

For customers: Can you tell me a bit about your current network setup and where you're facing the most challenges in IT today?

Great, now let's jump into the demo. One of the key features of Meraki is the Dashboard, which acts as a central platform for all your network management needs. Let's **log in to the Meraki Dashboard** and take a look at how it provides visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management for your network.

Imagine you're running a hotel chain and need to monitor and manage multiple locations. With Meraki, you can **easily view all your sites in one place** and quickly identify any issues that may arise. This level of visibility and control is crucial in the fast-paced Hospitality sector.

Now, let's take a look at a specific use case. Let's say a guest at one of your hotels is experiencing connectivity issues. With Meraki, you can **navigate to the client list** and pinpoint the exact device causing the problem. This kind of quick troubleshooting can greatly improve guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Another use case could be managing guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki, you can **set up different SSIDs for guests and staff** with just a few clicks on the Dashboard. This ensures a seamless and secure experience for all users.

Now, let's address a couple of common questions you might have:

Q: Can we integrate this with our existing systems and security policies?
