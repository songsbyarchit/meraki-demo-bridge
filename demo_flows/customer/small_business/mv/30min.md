Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo of Cisco Meraki's MV solution. I'm excited to show you how MV can transform your small business's security and surveillance needs. Let's dive in!

First off, could you share with me what your current network setup looks like and where your biggest IT headaches lie today?

**click 'Configure > Cameras'**

With Meraki MV, you can have a complete view of your business's physical spaces through high-quality, cloud-managed cameras. This means no more DVRs or NVRs to manage separately.

**click 'Live Tools > Motion Search'**

One key use case for MV is motion-based search, allowing you to easily find specific events or incidents that occurred in your environment. This can save you hours of manual review time.

**click 'Configure > Motion Alerts'**

Another great feature is motion alerts, which notify you in real-time of any suspicious activity detected by the cameras. This can significantly enhance your security monitoring capabilities.

**Q: How does this solution reduce IT workload in our small business environment?**  
**A:** Meraki simplifies management through one dashboard and automates many tasks like updates and troubleshooting.

**Q: What kind of ROI or cost reduction can we expect?**  
**A:** Customers often report major time savings and reduced downtime, especially for remote sites.

**Q: Can we integrate this with our existing systems and security policies?**
