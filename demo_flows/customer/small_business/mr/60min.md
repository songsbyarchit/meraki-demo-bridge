Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us today for our Meraki MR demo tailored for small businesses. My name is [Presenter] and I'll be guiding you through the next 60 minutes. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, this demo will show you the operational impact and cost justification of implementing Meraki MR in your organization.

Let's dive right in with our first use case: **setting up a guest network**. With Meraki MR, you can easily create a separate guest network with customizable access controls. This not only ensures the security of your internal network but also provides a seamless experience for your guests.

Next, let's talk about **network monitoring**. With Meraki MR, you can monitor your network in real-time, identify and troubleshoot issues quickly, and ensure optimal performance for your users. **Navigate to 'Monitor > Clients'** to see a live view of connected devices and their data usage.

Moving on to **application visibility and control**. Meraki MR allows you to prioritize critical applications over non-essential ones, ensuring a smooth user experience. **Go to 'Configure > Firewall & traffic shaping'** to set up application-based policies.

Now, let's discuss **remote troubleshooting**. With Meraki MR, you can remotely troubleshoot network issues without having to be on-site. This not only saves time and resources but also improves overall network efficiency. **Click 'Tools > Remote tools'** to access remote troubleshooting capabilities.

As we near the end of our demo, here are a few smart questions to prompt discussion:
1. How do you currently handle guest network access in your organization?
2. What challenges do you face in monitoring and troubleshooting network issues remotely?
3. How do you prioritize critical applications over non-essential ones in your current network setup?

Thank you for your time and attention. If you have any further questions or would like to explore Meraki MR further, feel free to reach out to our team. Have a great day!
