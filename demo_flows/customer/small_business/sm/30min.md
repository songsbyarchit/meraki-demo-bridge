Presenter: Hi there! Thank you for joining us today for our Meraki SM demo. I understand that you are looking for a solution for managing your small business network. Let's dive right in.

Use Case 1: Device Management
Presenter: One of the key features of Meraki SM is the ability to easily manage all your devices from a single dashboard. From laptops to smartphones to tablets, you can see all your devices in one place and even push out updates and security policies with just a few clicks. Let me show you how easy it is to do this. **Click 'Devices > Overview'**

Use Case 2: Security Compliance
Presenter: Security is always a top concern for small businesses, and with Meraki SM, you can ensure that all your devices are compliant with your security policies. You can set up automated alerts for any security breaches and quickly remediate any issues. Let me show you how you can set this up. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'**

Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting
Presenter: With more employees working remotely, it's essential to be able to troubleshoot any network issues quickly. With Meraki SM, you can remotely access devices, run diagnostics, and even push out fixes without having to physically be on-site. Let me demonstrate how you can do this. **Click 'Systems Manager > Remote Desktop'**

Presenter: Now, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions to prompt some discussion:

1. How do you currently manage your devices and ensure that they are secure and up-to-date?
2. Have you experienced any challenges with remote troubleshooting and device management in your current setup?
