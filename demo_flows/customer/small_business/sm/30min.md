Good morning and thank you for joining me today. I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's **SM** solution tailored for Small Business. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, this demo will showcase the operational impact and cost justification of implementing Meraki in your network. 

Let's start by discussing the trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in the Small Business sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into the demo. 

**Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Access**
Let's say you're a small retail business with limited IT resources. With Meraki, you can easily set up a secure guest Wi-Fi network for your customers while keeping your internal network separate. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to see how simple it is to configure and manage multiple networks from one dashboard.

**Use Case 2: Remote Site Management**
Imagine you have multiple branch offices that you need to manage remotely. Meraki's cloud-based dashboard allows you to monitor and troubleshoot network issues from anywhere. **Click 'Organization > Overview'** to see real-time status updates and **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to troubleshoot issues at a specific site.

**Use Case 3: Automated Security Updates**
Security is a top concern for small businesses. With Meraki, you can automate software updates and security patches across your network devices. **Click 'Security > Updates'** to see how easy it is to ensure your network is always protected.

Now, let's address some common questions you might have:
