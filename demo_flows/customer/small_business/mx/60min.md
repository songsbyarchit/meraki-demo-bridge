[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MX demo targeted towards small businesses. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, we understand the importance of operational impact and cost justification in your organization. Today, we'll be showcasing how the Meraki MX can streamline your network security and management processes, ultimately saving you time and money.

[Use Case 1: Secure Remote Access]
Let's start with one of the most common use cases for small businesses - secure remote access. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up secure VPN connections for remote employees to access company resources. **click 'Configure > VPN > Client VPN'**. This not only ensures data security but also improves productivity by enabling remote work flexibility.

[Use Case 2: Traffic Shaping]
Next, let's talk about traffic shaping. With the Meraki MX, you can prioritize critical applications and limit bandwidth for non-essential ones. **click 'Configure > Traffic Shaping'**. This ensures that your business-critical applications always have the necessary bandwidth, improving overall network performance and user experience.

[Use Case 3: Threat Protection]
Security is a top priority for any small business. The Meraki MX comes with built-in threat protection features such as intrusion prevention and content filtering. **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat protection'**. By proactively blocking malicious content and protecting against cyber threats, you can safeguard your network and sensitive data.

[Use Case 4: Cloud Management]
One of the key advantages of the Meraki MX is its cloud-based management platform. **click 'Dashboard'**. This allows you to easily monitor and manage your network from anywhere, reducing the need for onsite IT support and saving you time and resources.

[Smart Questions]
Now, before we conclude, I'd like to ask you a couple of smart questions to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing your network security and remote access for your employees?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face in terms of network management and security in your organization?

Thank you for your time and attention. We hope this demo has given you a better understanding of how the Meraki MX can benefit your small business. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss your specific needs, please feel free to reach out to us.
