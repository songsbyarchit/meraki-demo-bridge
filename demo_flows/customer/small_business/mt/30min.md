Presenter: Hello and thank you for joining us today for a demo of the Meraki MT solution tailored for small businesses. Whether you're an IT admin looking to simplify network management or a financial decision maker interested in cost-effective solutions, we're here to show you how Meraki MT can help streamline your operations and justify its cost.

Let's start by looking at a common use case for small businesses: setting up a secure and reliable network. With Meraki MT, you can easily **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to assign VLANs and prioritize traffic, ensuring that critical applications have the bandwidth they need to run smoothly. This not only enhances your network performance but also increases your team's productivity.

Another use case that we often see in small businesses is remote monitoring and troubleshooting. With Meraki MT's cloud-managed platform, you can **click 'Dashboard > Live Tools'** to remotely access and troubleshoot network devices from anywhere. This saves you time and resources by eliminating the need for on-site visits and reducing downtime.

Now, let's talk about cost justification. Meraki MT offers a subscription-based pricing model that includes all software updates, support, and security features. By investing in a Meraki MT solution, you can significantly reduce your IT maintenance costs and free up your budget for other strategic initiatives.
