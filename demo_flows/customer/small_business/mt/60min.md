Hello and welcome to our Meraki MT demo for Small Businesses. Today, we're going to show you how Meraki MT can revolutionize your network operations and provide cost savings for your business. Let's dive right in!

Use Case 1: Network Visibility
One of the key features of Meraki MT is its intuitive dashboard that provides real-time visibility into your network. **Click 'Network-wide > Overview'** to see a snapshot of your network health, including device status, traffic, and connectivity. This level of visibility allows you to quickly identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise, ultimately saving you time and resources.

Use Case 2: Remote Management
With Meraki MT, you can manage your network from anywhere in the world using the cloud-based dashboard. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see all the devices connected to your network and easily configure settings remotely. This remote management capability reduces the need for on-site IT support, saving you money on travel expenses and downtime.

Use Case 3: Automated Updates
Meraki MT automatically updates its firmware and security patches, ensuring that your network is always up to date and secure. **Click 'Configure > General'** to enable automatic updates and schedule maintenance windows to minimize disruption to your business operations. This automation not only enhances security but also reduces the burden on your IT team, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.

Use Case 4: Bandwidth Management
Meraki MT allows you to prioritize network traffic based on your business needs. **Click 'Configure > Traffic shaping'** to set up bandwidth limits for specific applications or users, ensuring that critical tasks are given priority. This feature helps optimize network performance and prevents congestion, ultimately improving productivity and user experience.
