[Use Case 2: Enhanced Security]
Presenter: Moving on to our second use case - enhanced security. With Meraki MS, you can **click 'Security > Access Control'** to set up granular access control policies for your network. This means you can control who has access to what resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
