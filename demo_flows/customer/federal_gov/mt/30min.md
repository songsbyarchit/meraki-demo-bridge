[Start with a brief introduction and welcoming the attendees to the demo]

Alright, thank you all for joining us today for this Meraki MT demo tailored for the Federal Gov sector. I understand the unique challenges and requirements you face in this industry, so I'm excited to show you how Meraki MT can help streamline your operations and justify the costs involved.

Let's jump right in with our first use case: network security. As IT admins or financial decision makers, you know how critical it is to ensure the security of sensitive government data. With Meraki MT, you can easily **click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN'** to set up firewall rules, VPN connections, and intrusion prevention to protect your network from cyber threats. This not only enhances your security posture but also reduces the risk of costly data breaches.

Next, let's talk about network visibility and troubleshooting. As IT admins, you're familiar with the challenges of identifying and resolving network issues quickly. With Meraki MT, you can **click 'Monitor > Live Tools'** to access real-time network diagnostics, such as packet captures and cable tests. This level of visibility allows you to proactively address network issues before they impact operations, saving time and resources.

For our final use case, let's discuss network scalability. As your agency grows and evolves, you need a networking solution that can easily scale to meet increasing demands. With Meraki MT, you can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to quickly add new devices to your network without the need for manual configuration. This scalability not only simplifies network management but also reduces the need for additional IT resources, ultimately saving you money in the long run.

Now, I'd like to hear from you. What are some specific challenges or pain points you're currently facing in your network operations? How do you see Meraki MT addressing those challenges? And finally, how do you envision the implementation of Meraki MT impacting your agency's operational efficiency and cost savings?

[End with two or three smart questions for discussion]
1. How do you currently manage network security and what are the key areas of improvement you're looking for?
2. What are your top priorities when it comes to network visibility and troubleshooting, and how do you think Meraki MT can help you achieve those goals?
3. In terms of network scalability, what are your growth projections for the next year, and how do you think Meraki MT can support your agency's expansion plans?
