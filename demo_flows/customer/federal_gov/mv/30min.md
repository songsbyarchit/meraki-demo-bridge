**Meraki MV Demo Script**

[Opening]
Presenter: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Meraki MV demo tailored specifically for the Federal Government sector. My name is [Presenter's name] and I'll be walking you through the capabilities and benefits of Meraki MV.

[Slide 1: Agenda]
Presenter: Let's start with a quick overview of what we'll cover in the next 30 minutes. We'll discuss the operational impact and cost justification of Meraki MV, followed by two to three use cases that are relevant to the Federal Government sector.

[Slide 2: Operational Impact]
Presenter: One of the key benefits of Meraki MV is its ease of use. With a centralized dashboard, IT admins can easily manage and monitor all cameras across multiple locations. **Let's take a look at the dashboard by clicking 'Cameras > Overview'.**

[Slide 3: Cost Justification]
Presenter: Now, let's talk about cost justification. Meraki MV offers a subscription-based pricing model that includes cloud storage, software updates, and support. This eliminates the need for expensive on-premise hardware and maintenance costs. **To view pricing details, click 'Organization > Licensing'**.

[Use Case 1: Security Monitoring]
Presenter: Imagine you have multiple government buildings that need to be monitored for security purposes. With Meraki MV, you can easily set up motion-based recording and alerts to ensure the safety of your facilities. **Let's configure motion-based recording by clicking 'Cameras > Settings'.**

[Use Case 2: Parking Lot Surveillance]
Presenter: Another use case for Meraki MV in the Federal Government sector is parking lot surveillance. By installing cameras in parking lots, you can monitor and analyze traffic patterns, ensuring the safety of employees and visitors. **To set up parking lot surveillance, click 'Cameras > Analytics'.**

[Smart Questions]
Presenter: Before we wrap up, I'd like to ask a couple of questions to prompt discussion. How important is video surveillance in your current security strategy? And how do you currently manage and monitor your existing camera systems?

[Closing]
Presenter: Thank you for attending our Meraki MV demo today. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss how Meraki MV can benefit your organization, feel free to reach out to our team. Have a great day!
