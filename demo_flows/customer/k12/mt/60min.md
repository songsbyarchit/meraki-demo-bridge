Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MT demo specifically tailored for the K12 sector. I understand that as IT admins or financial decision makers, you are constantly looking for ways to improve operational efficiency and cost savings within your organization. That's where Meraki MT can really make a difference.

Let's start by looking at some key use cases that are particularly relevant for the K12 sector.

1. **Network Visibility and Monitoring**: With Meraki MT, you can easily monitor the health and performance of your entire network from a single dashboard. This can help you quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise, ensuring that your students and teachers have uninterrupted access to the resources they need.

2. **Network Segmentation**: Meraki MT allows you to segment your network into different VLANs, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and reducing the risk of security breaches. This is crucial in a K12 environment where student information must be kept confidential.

3. **Remote Troubleshooting**: With Meraki MT, you can troubleshoot network issues remotely without having to physically be on-site. This can save you valuable time and resources, allowing you to quickly address any issues that may arise.

4. **Automated Network Optimization**: Meraki MT can automatically optimize your network settings based on traffic patterns, ensuring that your network is always running at peak performance. This can help reduce downtime and improve overall user experience.

Now, let's move on to a live demo where I will show you how easy it is to set up and manage your network using Meraki MT. **click 'Configure > Switch ports'**.

As we go through the demo, I encourage you to think about how these features could impact your operations and justify the cost of implementing Meraki MT in your organization.

Finally, I'd like to leave you with a couple of questions to consider:

1. How much time and resources are currently being spent on network troubleshooting and maintenance in your organization?
2. What specific challenges do you face in terms of network security and data protection in a K12 environment?

I look forward to discussing these questions and any other concerns you may have. Thank you for your time.
