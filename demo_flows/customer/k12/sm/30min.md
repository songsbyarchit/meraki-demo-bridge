Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for our Meraki SM demo tailored for the K12 sector. Today, we will be focusing on how Meraki SM can streamline your IT operations and provide cost-effective solutions for your school.

Let's dive right in. As IT admins or financial decision-makers, you understand the importance of managing a large number of devices efficiently. With Meraki SM, you can easily deploy, manage, and secure all your devices from a single dashboard, saving you time and resources.

Use Case 1: Let's say you have a fleet of Chromebooks used by students and teachers. With Meraki SM, you can remotely deploy apps, update software, and enforce security policies without having to physically touch each device. **click 'Systems Manager > Devices'**

Use Case 2: In a scenario where you need to track the location of a lost or stolen device, Meraki SM's geolocation feature can pinpoint the device's whereabouts in real-time, allowing you to take immediate action to recover it. **click 'Systems Manager > Monitor > Geofencing'**

Use Case 3: As a financial decision-maker, you may be concerned about the cost implications of implementing a new device management solution. With Meraki SM's cloud-based architecture, you can reduce hardware costs, minimize downtime, and lower IT support expenses, ultimately saving your school money in the long run.

Now, let's open the floor for questions and discussion. Here are a few smart questions you can consider:

1. How are you currently managing your devices, and what pain points are you experiencing in the process?
2. Have you calculated the total cost of ownership for your current device management solution, including hardware, software, and support costs?
3. What specific features or capabilities are you looking for in a device management solution, and how do you envision them benefiting your school?

Thank you for your time and attention. If you have any further questions or would like to schedule a personalized demo, please feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
