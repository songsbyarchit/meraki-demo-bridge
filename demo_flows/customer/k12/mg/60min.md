Whether you are an IT admin looking to streamline network management or a financial decision maker looking to optimize resources, this demo is for you.

[Use Case 1: Remote Learning]

Presenter: Let's start with a common scenario in the K12 sector - remote learning. With the Meraki MG, you can easily set up secure, reliable internet connections for students and teachers at home. **Navigate to 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to create separate networks for different user groups, ensuring that each user has the appropriate access levels.

With the Meraki MG, you can quickly deploy VPN connections to ensure secure communication between different school locations or between schools and the central office. **Click 'Configure > Site-to-Site VPN'** to set up encrypted tunnels for data transmission.

[Use Case 3: Traffic Optimization]

By leveraging SD-WAN technology, you can prioritize critical applications such as video conferencing or online testing, ensuring a smooth user experience for students and teachers. **Navigate to 'SD-WAN > Traffic Shaping'** to configure traffic prioritization rules.

[Use Case 4: Centralized Management]

Presenter: One of the biggest advantages of the Meraki MG is its centralized management platform. With a single dashboard, you can monitor and configure all your network devices, saving time and resources for your IT team. **Click 'Dashboard'** to see real-time network performance metrics and easily troubleshoot any issues.
