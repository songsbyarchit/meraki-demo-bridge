Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, this demo will show you the operational impact and cost justification of using Meraki SM in your retail environment.

[Use Case 1: Device Management]
Presenter: Let's start by looking at how Meraki SM can simplify device management in your retail stores. With Meraki SM, you can easily deploy, configure, and monitor all your devices from a single dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Overview'** to see a real-time view of all your devices, including smartphones, tablets, and POS systems. This level of visibility ensures that your devices are always up and running, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity.

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]
Presenter: Next, let's talk about security compliance. In the retail sector, it's crucial to ensure that all devices are secure and compliant with industry regulations. With Meraki SM, you can easily enforce security policies, push software updates, and remotely wipe devices in case of theft or loss. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to see how easy it is to set up and enforce security policies across all your devices, keeping your data safe and secure.

[Use Case 3: Inventory Management]

By using location-based tracking and geofencing capabilities, you can easily monitor the movement of inventory within your store. **Click 'Systems Manager > Proximity'** to see how you can set up proximity alerts to track when inventory moves in and out of designated areas. This level of visibility can help you optimize your inventory management processes and reduce the risk of shrinkage.
