Introduction:
Hello and welcome to our Meraki MG demo tailored for the Retail sector. Today, we will be discussing how the Meraki MG can revolutionize your network operations and drive cost savings. As IT admins or financial decision-makers, you understand the importance of efficiency and cost-effectiveness in your retail environment. Let's dive into the use cases and see how the Meraki MG can benefit your organization.

Use Case 1: Secure Payment Processing
One of the biggest concerns for retailers is ensuring secure payment processing. With the Meraki MG, you can easily set up VLANs to segregate your payment processing network from other parts of your network. This ensures that sensitive customer data is protected and PCI compliance is maintained. **click 'Configure > VLANs'**

Use Case 2: Remote Monitoring and Troubleshooting
As a retail IT admin, you know the challenges of managing multiple locations. With the Meraki MG, you can remotely monitor and troubleshoot network issues across all your retail stores from a single dashboard. This reduces the need for on-site visits and saves both time and money. **click 'Monitor > Live Tools'**

Use Case 3: Guest Wi-Fi Access
Offering guest Wi-Fi is a common practice in retail stores, but it can also pose security risks. With the Meraki MG, you can easily set up a separate guest network with limited access to ensure that your main network remains secure. This feature not only improves customer experience but also protects your internal network. **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'**

Use Case 4: Bandwidth Management
Bandwidth management is crucial in a retail environment where multiple devices are connected at all times. With the Meraki MG, you can prioritize bandwidth for critical applications such as POS systems or VoIP calls, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted shopping experience for your customers. **click 'Configure > Traffic Shaping'**
