[Opening]

Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us today for this demo of the Meraki MG, specifically tailored for the Retail sector. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, we understand the importance of operational impact and cost justification in your organization.

[Use Case 1: Secure Guest Wi-Fi Access]

Let's start with a common use case in the Retail sector - providing secure guest Wi-Fi access. With the Meraki MG, you can easily set up a separate network for your customers to access the internet without compromising the security of your internal network. Simply **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a new SSID specifically for guest access. This not only enhances the shopping experience for your customers but also ensures the protection of your sensitive data.

[Use Case 2: Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting]

Another important aspect for Retail businesses is network monitoring and troubleshooting. With the Meraki MG, you have real-time visibility into your network performance and can quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise. **Click 'Monitor > Wireless > Clients'** to see a list of all connected devices and their status. This level of visibility not only improves operational efficiency but also minimizes downtime, ultimately saving you time and money.

[Use Case 3: Inventory Management System Integration]

Lastly, let's talk about integrating the Meraki MG with your inventory management system. By **clicking 'Configure > Switch ports'**, you can easily connect your inventory scanners and POS systems to the network, ensuring seamless communication between devices. This integration streamlines your inventory management processes, reduces human error, and ultimately improves the overall efficiency of your retail operations.

[Smart Questions]

Now, I'd like to prompt some discussion with a couple of smart questions:

1. How do you currently handle guest Wi-Fi access in your retail environment, and what challenges have you faced in terms of security and performance?
2. What level of visibility do you currently have into your network performance and how do you handle troubleshooting when issues arise?
3. Have you considered integrating your inventory management system with your network infrastructure, and if so, what benefits do you hope to achieve from this integration?

Thank you for your time and attention. We hope this demo has provided you with valuable insights into how the Meraki MG can benefit your retail business. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss a customized solution for your organization, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
