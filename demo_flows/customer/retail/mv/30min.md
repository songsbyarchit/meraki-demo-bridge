Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo of Cisco Meraki's MV solution tailored for the Retail sector. I'm excited to show you how MV can revolutionize your network setup and streamline your operations. 

To kick things off, let me ask you: What does your current network setup look like in your retail environment? And where are your biggest IT headaches today? 

Now, let's dive into the demo. **Click 'Cameras > Overview'** to see how the Meraki Dashboard provides a single pane of glass for all your MV cameras, allowing for easy visibility and management. **Click 'Camera > Live'** to view real-time footage of your store, enabling simplified troubleshooting and enhanced security.

Another key use case for MV in the Retail sector is people counting. By **clicking 'Analytics > People Count'**, you can track foot traffic in your store and optimize staffing levels accordingly.

One more feature we'll explore is the motion search capability. **Click 'Video > Motion Search'** to quickly find footage of a specific event or person, saving you time and effort in investigations.

Now, let's address some common questions you might have about MV in the Retail sector:
