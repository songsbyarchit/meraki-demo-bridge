Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MT demo tailored for the Retail sector. Today, we're going to show you how Meraki MT can help streamline your network operations, improve efficiency, and ultimately save you time and money.

Let's dive right in. Imagine you're managing multiple retail locations and you need to monitor and manage the network at each store remotely. With Meraki MT, you can easily do this from one centralized dashboard. **Click 'Dashboard'** to see an overview of all your locations and their network status.

Now, let's talk about security. In retail, it's crucial to ensure that your network is secure to protect customer data and prevent breaches. With Meraki MT, you can set up firewall rules, VPNs, and intrusion detection to keep your network safe. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN'** to see the options available.

Another key use case for Meraki MT in retail is inventory management. By using IoT sensors and cameras, you can track inventory levels in real-time and receive alerts when stock is running low. This can help you avoid stockouts and improve customer satisfaction. **Click 'Cameras & Sensors'** to see how this works.

Now, let's talk about cost justification. With Meraki MT, you can reduce the time and resources needed to manage your network, leading to cost savings in the long run. Additionally, by improving network security and inventory management, you can prevent losses due to data breaches or stockouts.
