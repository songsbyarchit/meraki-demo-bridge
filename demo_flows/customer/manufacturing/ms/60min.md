Presenter: Hello, and welcome to our Meraki MS demo tailored for the manufacturing sector. Today, we will be discussing how Meraki MS can optimize your network infrastructure to improve operational efficiency and cost savings. Let's dive right in.

[05:00 - 15:00]
Use Case 1: Network Visibility
Presenter: With Meraki MS, you can gain real-time visibility into your network with the dashboard's intuitive interface. With just a few clicks, you can **navigate to 'Monitor > Switches'** to see a comprehensive overview of all your switches, including status, traffic, and connected devices. This level of visibility allows you to quickly identify and resolve any network issues, minimizing downtime and improving productivity.
