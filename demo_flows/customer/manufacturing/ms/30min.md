Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MS solution can revolutionize your network management in the Manufacturing sector. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, this demo will showcase how Meraki can streamline operations and provide cost justification for your organization.

To kick things off, let me ask you: What does your current network setup look like in your manufacturing environment? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?

Let's now explore a couple of use cases tailored to the Manufacturing sector:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Imagine having complete visibility into your network infrastructure, from the shop floor to the back office. With Meraki Dashboard's single pane of glass view, you can **click 'Monitor > Switches'** to track performance metrics and quickly identify any issues.

2. **Remote Troubleshooting**: Dealing with network issues at remote manufacturing sites can be a real challenge. But with Meraki's cloud-based architecture, you can **click 'Tools > Remote connection'** to troubleshoot problems from anywhere, saving time and resources.

Now, let's address some common questions Manufacturing customers might have:
