[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MR demo tailored for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we'll be exploring how Meraki MR can revolutionize your network infrastructure and enhance operational efficiency. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, this demo will showcase the tangible benefits and cost justification of implementing Meraki MR in your manufacturing environment.

[Use Case 1: Real-time Location Tracking]

Let's start with real-time location tracking. With Meraki MR, you can easily track the location of assets, equipment, and even personnel within your manufacturing facility. This not only improves operational efficiency by reducing search time but also enhances security by quickly identifying any unauthorized movement.

To set up real-time location tracking, **click 'Configure > Wireless > Location Analytics'**. From here, you can view real-time location data and generate reports to optimize asset utilization and streamline workflows.

[Use Case 2: Seamless Device Onboarding]

Next, let's talk about seamless device onboarding. With Meraki MR, you can easily onboard new devices onto your network without the need for manual configuration. This saves time for your IT team and ensures that new devices are securely connected to the network.

To enable seamless device onboarding, **click 'Configure > Wireless > Splash page'**. Here, you can customize the onboarding process for different types of devices and streamline the connection process for your manufacturing equipment.

[Use Case 3: Network Segmentation]

Now, let's discuss network segmentation. In a manufacturing environment, it's crucial to segment your network to ensure that sensitive data is protected and different devices are isolated from each other. Meraki MR allows you to easily create network segments and control access based on user roles.

To set up network segmentation, **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'**. Here, you can create separate SSIDs for different departments or devices, ensuring that your network remains secure and optimized for productivity.

[Use Case 4: Automated Troubleshooting]

Moving on to automated troubleshooting. With Meraki MR, you can proactively monitor your network and identify potential issues before they impact your operations. This reduces downtime and allows your IT team to focus on strategic initiatives rather than firefighting.

To access automated troubleshooting tools, **click 'Monitor > Wireless > Clients'**. Here, you can view real-time client data and receive alerts for any potential network issues that need attention.

[Smart Questions]

As we wrap up our demo, I'd like to ask you a couple of smart questions to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently track the location of assets within your manufacturing facility, and what challenges do you face in this process?
2. What are your key priorities when it comes to network security and access control in your manufacturing environment?

Thank you for joining our Meraki MR demo today. We hope you've gained valuable insights into how Meraki MR can transform your manufacturing network infrastructure and drive operational excellence.
