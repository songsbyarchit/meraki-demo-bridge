[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MG demo tailored for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we will explore how the Meraki MG can revolutionize your network infrastructure and improve your operational efficiency. Whether you're an IT admin looking to streamline your network management or a financial decision maker focused on cost savings, this demo is designed to showcase the benefits of the Meraki MG in a manufacturing environment.

[Use Case 1: Remote Monitoring and Troubleshooting]
Let's start with a common scenario in manufacturing - equipment downtime. With the Meraki MG, you can remotely monitor and troubleshoot network issues in real-time. **Navigate to the Meraki dashboard and click 'Monitor > Network Health'** to see an overview of your network status. This feature not only reduces downtime but also improves overall operational efficiency.

[Use Case 2: Secure Connectivity for IoT Devices]
Manufacturing facilities often have a large number of IoT devices that need to be securely connected to the network. The Meraki MG offers advanced security features such as integrated firewall and VPN capabilities. **Go to 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to configure firewall rules for your IoT devices, ensuring secure connectivity without compromising network performance.

[Use Case 3: Quality of Service (QoS) for Critical Applications]
In a manufacturing environment, certain applications require priority bandwidth to ensure smooth operations. With the Meraki MG, you can easily prioritize traffic through Quality of Service (QoS) settings. **Select 'Traffic Shaping' under 'SD-WAN & traffic shaping'** to allocate bandwidth for critical applications such as production monitoring systems or inventory management tools.

[Use Case 4: Scalability and Flexibility]
As your manufacturing facility grows, so does your network infrastructure. The Meraki MG offers scalability and flexibility to accommodate your expanding network needs. **Navigate to 'Switch ports > Add new switch'** to seamlessly add new devices to your network without disrupting existing operations. This scalability feature saves time and resources, making it a cost-effective solution for your manufacturing facility.
