Hello and welcome to our Meraki Systems Manager demo for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we'll be discussing how Meraki SM can streamline your IT operations and help you save costs in the long run.

[Slide 1: Introduction]
Let's start by talking about the challenges faced by IT admins in the Manufacturing sector. With a large number of devices spread across multiple locations, managing and securing them can be quite a daunting task. This is where Meraki SM comes in.

[Slide 2: Use Case 1 - Device Management]
One of the key features of Meraki SM is its device management capabilities. With Meraki SM, you can easily enroll, configure, and manage all your devices from a central dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see a list of all your devices and their status. This not only saves time for IT admins but also ensures that all devices are up-to-date and secure.

[Slide 3: Use Case 2 - Security Compliance]
Security is a top priority for any organization, especially in the Manufacturing sector where sensitive data is involved. Meraki SM helps you ensure that all devices are compliant with security policies and have the latest security patches installed. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to set up policies that enforce security standards across all devices.

[Slide 4: Use Case 3 - Remote Troubleshooting]
In a manufacturing environment, downtime can be costly. With Meraki SM, you can remotely troubleshoot and fix issues on devices without having to physically be present on-site. **Click 'Systems Manager > Remote Desktop'** to see a live demonstration of how you can troubleshoot a device remotely.

[Slide 5: Cost Justification]
Now, let's talk about cost justification. While investing in a solution like Meraki SM may seem like an additional expense, the operational impact it can have on your organization can result in long-term cost savings. By reducing downtime, improving device management efficiency, and ensuring security compliance, Meraki SM can help you save costs in the long run.

[Slide 6: Smart Questions]
To prompt discussion, here are two smart questions you can ask:
1. How much time do your IT admins currently spend on device management tasks?
2. Have you faced any security compliance issues in the past, and how did you address them?
