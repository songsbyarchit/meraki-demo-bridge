[Opening]

Presenter: Hello and welcome to our Meraki MT demo for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we'll be discussing how Meraki's cloud-managed networking solutions can improve operational efficiency and cost savings for your manufacturing facility. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, this demo is tailored to show you the tangible benefits of incorporating Meraki MT into your infrastructure.

[Use Case 1: Real-time Monitoring and Troubleshooting]

Presenter: Let's start with a common scenario in manufacturing - downtime due to network issues. With Meraki MT, you can monitor your network in real-time and quickly identify any issues that may arise. **Navigate to 'Monitor > Live Tools'** and you'll see a live feed of your network's health status. This visibility allows you to proactively address any potential problems before they impact production.

[Use Case 2: Secure Access Control]

Presenter: Another critical aspect in manufacturing is controlling access to sensitive areas of your facility. With Meraki MT, you can easily set up access control policies based on user roles and device types. **Go to 'Configure > Access Policies'** and you can create rules to restrict access to certain areas or equipment. This not only improves security but also ensures compliance with industry regulations.

[Use Case 3: Scalability and Flexibility]

Presenter: As your manufacturing facility grows, so does the complexity of your network infrastructure. Meraki MT offers scalability and flexibility to easily expand your network without the need for additional hardware. **Navigate to 'Configure > Switch ports'** and you can add new devices to your network seamlessly. This flexibility not only saves you time and money but also ensures that your network can adapt to the changing needs of your business.

[Smart Questions]

Presenter: Now, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions to prompt discussion:
1. How much time and resources does your current IT team spend on network monitoring and troubleshooting?
2. Have you faced any compliance issues related to access control in your manufacturing facility?
3. What are your plans for network expansion in the next 2-3 years, and how do you see Meraki MT fitting into those plans?
