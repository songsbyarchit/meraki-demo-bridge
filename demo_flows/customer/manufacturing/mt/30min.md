Hello and welcome to our demo of Cisco Meraki for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we will be focusing on how the Meraki Dashboard can help streamline operations and justify costs for your organization.

Before we dive in, I'd like to ask: What does your current network setup look like in your manufacturing facility? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?

Now, let's explore how Meraki can address these challenges with our tailored solutions.

**Use Case 1: Real-time Monitoring**
Let's start by **clicking on 'Monitor > Overview'** in the Meraki Dashboard. Here, you can see real-time data on network performance, device connectivity, and application usage. This level of visibility can help you proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact production.

**Use Case 2: Simplified Troubleshooting**
Now, let's **navigate to 'Tools > Ping'** in the Dashboard. With just a few clicks, you can troubleshoot connectivity issues across your network, saving valuable time and resources. The intuitive interface makes it easy for IT admins to pinpoint and resolve issues quickly.

**Use Case 3: Unified Management**
Next, let's **explore 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN'** in the Dashboard. Meraki's centralized platform allows you to manage security policies, VPN settings, and SD-WAN configurations all in one place.
