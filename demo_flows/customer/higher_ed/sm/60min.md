Hello and welcome to our Meraki Systems Manager demo! Today, we're going to explore how Meraki SM can revolutionize the way IT teams in Higher Ed institutions manage their devices. Whether you're an IT admin looking to streamline operations or a financial decision maker seeking cost-effective solutions, Meraki SM has something for everyone. 

[Use Case 1: Device Provisioning]
Let's start with device provisioning. With Meraki SM, you can easily deploy hundreds of devices at once, saving your IT team countless hours. Simply **click 'Systems Manager > Add Devices'** and follow the prompts to enroll new devices in minutes, not days. This efficiency not only boosts productivity but also reduces the risk of errors during deployment.

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]
Next, let's talk about security compliance. In the Higher Ed sector, protecting sensitive student and faculty data is paramount. With Meraki SM, you can enforce security policies on all devices, ensuring that every endpoint is up-to-date and protected against cyber threats. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to see how easy it is to set up and manage security protocols across your entire network.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]
Now, let's dive into remote troubleshooting. Imagine being able to resolve device issues without leaving your desk. With Meraki SM, you can remotely access devices, troubleshoot problems, and even push updates with just a few **clicks 'Systems Manager > Remote Desktop'**. This level of control not only improves user experience but also reduces downtime and support costs.

[Use Case 4: Asset Tracking]
Moving on to asset tracking, Meraki SM offers real-time visibility into all your devices, making it easy to track inventory and monitor usage patterns. **Click 'Systems Manager > Inventory'** to see how you can easily identify unused devices, optimize resources, and make data-driven decisions that save you money in the long run.
