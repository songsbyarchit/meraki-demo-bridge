Hey there, thank you for joining us for this demo! I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MR solution can transform your network operations in the Higher Education sector. 

Let's start by diving into the Meraki Dashboard. This single pane of glass provides you with complete visibility into your network, making troubleshooting a breeze. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time insights into user activity.

Now, let's explore some specific Higher Education use cases. Imagine being able to easily segment network access for students, faculty, and guests. With MR, you can **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to create different policies for each user group.

Another key feature for Higher Education is the ability to quickly deploy and manage access points across multiple campuses. **Click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to see how easy it is to add new devices and monitor their performance.
