[Opening]

Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MR demo tailored for the Higher Ed sector. Today, we will be showcasing the operational impact and cost justification of implementing Meraki MR in your network. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, you'll see how Meraki MR can provide value to your institution.

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility]
Let's start with one of the key features of Meraki MR - network visibility. With Meraki's dashboard, you can easily monitor your network and see real-time data on connected devices, bandwidth usage, and application usage. This level of visibility allows you to quickly identify and troubleshoot any network issues that may arise. To access this feature, **click 'Monitor > Clients'**.

[Use Case 2: Seamless User Experience]
Next, let's talk about providing a seamless user experience for students, faculty, and staff. Meraki MR allows you to create different SSIDs for different user groups, ensuring that each group has the appropriate access and security settings. You can also set up guest access portals for visiting guests. To set up different SSIDs, **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'**.

[Use Case 3: Location Analytics]
Another valuable use case for Higher Ed institutions is location analytics. Meraki MR can provide insights into foot traffic patterns on campus, helping you optimize space utilization and improve the overall campus experience. By analyzing this data, you can make informed decisions about where to place Wi-Fi access points and other resources. To access location analytics, **click 'Location Analytics'**.

[Use Case 4: Automated RF Optimization]
Meraki MR also offers automated RF optimization, which helps ensure that your wireless network is running at peak performance. With Meraki's intelligent algorithms, the system can automatically adjust channel and power settings to minimize interference and maximize coverage. This saves you time and effort in manually optimizing your network. To enable automated RF optimization, **click 'Wireless > Radio Settings'**.

[Smart Questions]
As we wrap up, here are a few questions to consider:
1. How do you currently monitor and manage your network? Are there any pain points you experience in this process?
2. What are your biggest challenges in providing a seamless user experience for students, faculty, and staff on your network?
3. How do you currently gather data on campus foot traffic and space utilization? How could location analytics benefit your institution?
