Presenter: Hi everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MT demo. Today, we're going to focus on how Meraki's cloud-managed networking solutions can benefit Higher Ed institutions like yours. Whether you're an IT admin or a financial decision maker, we believe that Meraki can have a significant impact on your operations and help justify the cost.

Let's start with a use case that many Higher Ed institutions face: managing a large campus network with multiple buildings and thousands of devices. With Meraki's centralized dashboard, you can easily **click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Overview'** to get a real-time view of your entire network. This level of visibility and control can help you troubleshoot issues faster and ensure a seamless experience for students and faculty.

Another use case that may resonate with you is the need for secure and reliable Wi-Fi access in dormitories and lecture halls. With Meraki's access points, you can **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to see detailed analytics on user activity and performance. This data can help you optimize your network resources and ensure that students have a fast and reliable connection at all times.

Now, let's talk about cost justification. Meraki's subscription-based model eliminates the need for costly hardware upgrades and maintenance. With a simple, predictable monthly fee, you can easily budget for your networking needs and avoid unexpected expenses. Plus, with Meraki's intuitive interface, you can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to quickly make changes and updates without the need for specialized training or additional staff.

To wrap up, I'd like to leave you with a couple of questions to prompt discussion:
1. How much time and resources are currently spent on managing your network infrastructure?
2. What are the top priorities for your institution when it comes to networking and IT infrastructure?

Thank you for your time today, and we look forward to helping you explore how Meraki can transform your Higher Ed network.
