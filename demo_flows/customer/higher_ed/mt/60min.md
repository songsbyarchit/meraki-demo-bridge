[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MT demo! Today, we're going to explore how Meraki's cloud-managed networking solutions can benefit your Higher Ed institution. Whether you're an IT admin looking to streamline operations or a financial decision maker interested in cost justification, we've got you covered.

[Use Case 1: Simplified Network Management]

Let's start with a common pain point in Higher Ed IT departments - managing a large network spread across multiple buildings or campuses. With Meraki's centralized dashboard, you can **click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Overview'** to get a bird's eye view of your entire network. This makes it easy to see any issues or anomalies and take proactive measures to address them before they impact users.

[Use Case 2: Enhanced Security]

Security is always a top concern in Higher Ed, especially with the sensitive data and research being conducted. With Meraki's built-in security features, you can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to set up policies to restrict access to certain websites or applications. You can also **click 'Wireless > Access Control'** to easily create guest networks with limited access, keeping your main network secure.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]

As an IT admin, you know that network issues can pop up at any time, often when you're not on campus. With Meraki's remote troubleshooting capabilities, you can **click 'Wireless > RF Spectrum'** to analyze wireless interference or **click 'Switch > Stacking'** to troubleshoot connectivity problems on your switches. This saves you time and resources by allowing you to diagnose and resolve issues without having to physically be on-site.

[Use Case 4: Scalability and Future-Proofing]

In Higher Ed, network needs are constantly evolving as new technologies are adopted and user demands change. With Meraki's scalable solutions, you can **click 'Organization > Inventory'** to easily add new devices or **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to expand your wireless coverage without the need for additional hardware. This ensures that your network can grow with your institution's needs, saving you money in the long run.

[Closing]
