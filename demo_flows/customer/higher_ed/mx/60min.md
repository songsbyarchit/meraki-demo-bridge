[Opening]

Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for our Meraki MX demo tailored for the Higher Ed sector. My name is [Presenter] and I'll be walking you through some key use cases and benefits of implementing the Meraki MX solution at your institution.

Let's dive right in!

[Use Case 1: Network Security]
Presenter: One of the main concerns for Higher Ed institutions is network security. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'**. This not only protects your network from external threats but also ensures compliance with industry regulations.

[Use Case 2: Secure VPN Access]
Presenter: Another important use case is providing secure VPN access for students and staff. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up VPN tunnels for remote access. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN'**. This allows for secure connectivity, especially in situations like remote learning or working from home.

[Use Case 3: Application Optimization]
Presenter: Meraki MX also offers application optimization features that prioritize critical applications over less important ones. This ensures a smooth user experience for students and staff. **Click 'Traffic Shaping'**. This can be particularly useful during peak usage times, such as registration periods or exam weeks.

[Use Case 4: Content Filtering]
Presenter: Content filtering is another important aspect for Higher Ed institutions. With Meraki MX, you can easily block access to inappropriate websites and protect your network from malware. **Click 'Content Filtering'**. This helps maintain a safe and secure browsing environment for all users.

[Use Case 5: SD-WAN for Multi-site Connectivity]
Presenter: For institutions with multiple campuses or sites, Meraki MX offers SD-WAN capabilities that simplify connectivity and management. **Click 'Site-to-site VPN'**. This allows for seamless communication between different locations and ensures consistent network performance.

[Use Case 6: Traffic Analytics]
Presenter: Lastly, Meraki MX provides detailed traffic analytics that give you insights into network usage and performance. **Click 'Monitor > Traffic Analytics'**. This information can help you make informed decisions about network optimization and capacity planning.

[Prompting Questions]

Presenter: Now that we've covered some key use cases, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions to prompt discussion:
1. How do you currently handle network security and compliance at your institution?
2. What are some pain points you face in terms of network connectivity and performance across multiple campuses or sites?
3. How do you measure the effectiveness of your current network infrastructure in meeting the needs of students and staff?

[Closing]

Presenter: Thank you for your time today. I hope this demo has given you a better understanding of how Meraki MX can benefit your Higher Ed institution.
