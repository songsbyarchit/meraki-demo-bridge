[Opening]

Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for our Meraki MS demo targeted at the State Local Gov sector. Today, we'll be focusing on how Meraki MS can improve operational efficiency and help with cost savings in your organization. 

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility and Control]

Presenter: One of the key benefits of Meraki MS is its network visibility and control. With Meraki's intuitive dashboard, you can easily see all your network devices in one place and quickly identify any issues. For example, if there's a switch port that's experiencing high traffic, you can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to investigate further and make necessary adjustments to optimize performance. This level of visibility and control can help IT admins proactively manage their network and reduce downtime.

[Use Case 2: Automated Network Provisioning]

Presenter: Another use case for Meraki MS is automated network provisioning. With Meraki's Zero Touch Deployment, you can easily set up new network devices without the need for manual configuration. This is especially useful for State Local Gov organizations that may have multiple locations to manage. By simply plugging in a new switch, it can automatically connect to the dashboard and download the appropriate configurations, saving IT admins time and reducing the risk of human error.

[Use Case 3: Centralized Network Management]

Presenter: Lastly, Meraki MS offers centralized network management, allowing IT admins to easily monitor and manage all their network devices from one place. This can help streamline operations and improve overall efficiency. For example, you can **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see all connected devices on your network and quickly troubleshoot any connectivity issues. This level of centralized management can help State Local Gov organizations streamline their IT operations and reduce the need for manual intervention.

[Smart Questions]

Presenter: Now, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions to prompt some discussion. How are you currently managing your network devices across multiple locations? And have you experienced any challenges with network visibility and control in the past?

[Closing]

Presenter: In conclusion, Meraki MS offers State Local Gov organizations the tools they need to improve operational efficiency and cost savings. With features like network visibility and control, automated network provisioning, and centralized management, Meraki MS can help IT admins streamline their operations and make better use of their resources. Thank you for joining us today, and feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.
