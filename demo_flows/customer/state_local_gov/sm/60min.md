[Opening]

Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki SM demo tailored specifically for the State Local Gov sector. As IT admins or financial decision makers, I know you're constantly balancing operational efficiency and cost effectiveness. Today, we'll be showcasing how Meraki SM can help streamline your device management processes and provide cost justification for your organization.

[Use Case 1: Device Inventory Management]
Let's start with the first use case: Device Inventory Management. With Meraki SM, you can easily keep track of all the devices in your network. Simply **click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see a comprehensive list of all devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This visibility allows you to quickly identify any missing or unaccounted for devices, ensuring better security and asset management.

[Use Case 2: Remote Troubleshooting]
Next, let's talk about Remote Troubleshooting. With Meraki SM, IT admins can remotely diagnose and fix device issues without having to be physically present. **Click 'Systems Manager > Remote Tools'** to access features like remote desktop control and real-time device monitoring. This capability not only saves time and resources but also minimizes downtime for your end users.

[Use Case 3: Security Compliance]
Moving on to Security Compliance, which is crucial for government organizations. Meraki SM helps ensure that all devices are up to date with the latest security patches and policies. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to set up automated compliance checks and enforce security protocols across all devices. This proactive approach reduces the risk of security breaches and ensures compliance with industry regulations.

[Use Case 4: Application Management]
Let's also touch on Application Management. With Meraki SM, you can easily deploy, update, and remove applications on all devices from a centralized platform. **Click 'Systems Manager > Apps'** to see a list of installed applications and manage their distribution. This feature simplifies the application lifecycle process and enhances user productivity.

[Smart Questions]
Now, I'd like to ask you a couple of smart questions to prompt discussion:
1. How are you currently managing device inventory and security compliance in your organization?
2. What challenges do you face when it comes to remote troubleshooting and application management for your devices?

[Closing]
In conclusion, Meraki SM offers a comprehensive solution for device management that can significantly improve operational efficiency and provide cost justification for your organization.
