Welcome everyone to our Meraki SM demo specifically tailored for the State Local Gov sector. Today, we'll be discussing how Meraki SM can help streamline your IT operations and justify costs within your organization.

First, let's talk about the operational impact Meraki SM can have. As IT admins, you know the struggle of managing a large fleet of devices across multiple locations. With Meraki SM, you can **easily deploy software and updates** to all your devices from a single dashboard. No more manual updates or individual configurations, saving you time and resources.

Now, let's dive into a use case. Imagine a scenario where a security patch needs to be deployed to all devices in your organization. With Meraki SM, you can **schedule the deployment** during off-peak hours to minimize disruption to your employees. This not only ensures the security of your devices but also maintains productivity within your organization.

Next, let's discuss cost justification. As financial decision makers, you're always looking for ways to optimize spending. Meraki SM can help you do just that by **providing detailed insights** into device usage and performance. This allows you to identify areas where resources are being underutilized and make informed decisions on where to allocate your budget effectively.

Another use case to consider is device tracking. With Meraki SM, you can **track the location of all devices** within your organization in real-time. This not only improves asset management but also enhances security by quickly locating lost or stolen devices.

To prompt discussion, here are two smart questions you can ask:

1. How much time and resources does your IT team currently spend on manual device management tasks?
2. What are the main challenges you face in terms of device security and compliance within your organization?

We hope this demo has given you a glimpse into the capabilities of Meraki SM and how it can benefit your State Local Gov organization. Thank you for joining us today.
