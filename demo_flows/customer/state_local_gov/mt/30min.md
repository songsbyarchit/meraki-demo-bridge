[Start of Demo]

Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MT demo tailored for the State Local Gov sector. I'm excited to show you how Meraki MT can revolutionize your network operations and provide cost-effective solutions for your organization.

Let's start by looking at the dashboard. **Click 'Dashboard'**. Here, you can see an overview of your network, including connected devices, network health, and any potential issues that need attention. This visibility is crucial for IT admins to quickly identify and resolve any network issues, ensuring smooth operations for your organization.

Now, let's dive into a use case - network segmentation. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'**. With Meraki MT, you can easily create different VLANs to segment your network, allowing you to control access and improve security. This is especially important for State Local Gov organizations handling sensitive data and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Next, let's explore another use case - remote management. **Click 'Systems Manager'**. Meraki MT enables IT admins to remotely manage devices, push software updates, and enforce security policies from a centralized dashboard. This not only improves efficiency but also reduces the need for on-site visits, saving time and resources for your organization.

Now, let's talk about cost justification. Meraki MT offers a cloud-managed solution that eliminates the need for expensive hardware and on-premise management systems. This reduces upfront costs and ongoing maintenance expenses, providing a cost-effective solution for State Local Gov organizations with limited budgets.

To wrap up, I'd like to leave you with a few smart questions to prompt discussion:

1. How much time and resources are currently spent on network troubleshooting and maintenance?
2. What are the key security challenges your organization faces in managing a complex network infrastructure?
3. How do you currently handle remote device management and software updates for your network?

Thank you for your time, and please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or would like to explore Meraki MT further for your organization.
