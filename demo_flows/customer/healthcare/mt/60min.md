[Opening]

Welcome everyone to our Meraki MT demo, specifically tailored for the Healthcare sector. Today, we will be exploring how Meraki MT can help streamline operations and improve efficiency in healthcare organizations. Whether you are an IT admin looking to simplify network management or a financial decision maker seeking cost-effective solutions, this demo is for you.

[Use Case 1: Real-time Location Tracking]
Let's start with one of the most critical use cases in healthcare - real-time location tracking. With Meraki MT, you can easily track the location of medical equipment, staff, and patients in real-time. This not only improves asset management but also enhances patient care by reducing wait times and increasing staff efficiency.

To see this in action, **click 'Dashboard > Location Analytics'** to view the real-time location of devices on the map.

[Use Case 2: Patient Wi-Fi Experience]
Next, let's talk about patient Wi-Fi experience. In healthcare facilities, patients often rely on Wi-Fi to stay connected with their loved ones or entertain themselves during their stay. With Meraki MT, you can ensure a seamless Wi-Fi experience for patients while maintaining network security and compliance with HIPAA regulations.

To configure patient Wi-Fi access, **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** and set up a secure guest network for patients.

[Use Case 3: Automated Network Provisioning]
Moving on to network provisioning, Meraki MT simplifies the process of setting up and managing network infrastructure. With automated network provisioning, you can easily deploy new devices, configure network settings, and monitor network performance in real-time. This not only saves time for IT admins but also reduces the risk of human errors.

To automate network provisioning, **click 'Dashboard > Network-wide > Configure > General'** to set up automated network provisioning rules.

[Use Case 4: Security and Compliance Monitoring]
In the healthcare sector, security and compliance are top priorities. With Meraki MT, you can proactively monitor network security and compliance with built-in tools for threat detection, access control, and compliance reporting. This ensures that your network is secure and compliant with industry regulations at all times.

To monitor security and compliance, **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security > Advanced Security'** to view security alerts and compliance reports.

2. What challenges do you face in providing a seamless Wi-Fi experience for patients in your organization?
3. How do you ensure network security and compliance with industry regulations in your healthcare network?
