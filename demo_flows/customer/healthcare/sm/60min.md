[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki SM demo for the Healthcare sector. Today, we'll be focusing on how Meraki SM can revolutionize the way IT admins manage their network infrastructure and devices in a healthcare setting. Let's dive right in!

[Use Case 1: Device Management]
First up, let's talk about device management. With Meraki SM, you can easily manage all your healthcare devices from a single dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see real-time information on each device, including location, usage, and security status. This simplifies the IT admin's job and ensures that all devices are up-to-date and secure.

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]
Next, let's discuss security compliance. In the healthcare sector, data security is paramount. Meraki SM allows you to enforce security policies across all devices, ensuring that patient information is protected at all times. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to see how easy it is to set up and enforce these policies on all your devices.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]
Now, let's talk about remote troubleshooting. With Meraki SM, IT admins can troubleshoot device issues remotely, saving time and resources. **Click 'Systems Manager > Remote Tools'** to see how you can remotely access devices, diagnose problems, and even push updates without ever leaving your desk.

[Use Case 4: Asset Tracking]
Another important use case in healthcare is asset tracking. With Meraki SM, you can easily track the location and usage of all your devices, ensuring that nothing goes missing or gets misplaced. **Click 'Systems Manager > Inventory'** to see how you can keep tabs on all your devices in real-time.

[Smart Questions]
To prompt discussion with the attendee, here are two smart questions you can ask:
1. How much time and resources do you currently spend on managing and securing your healthcare devices?
2. Are there any specific challenges or pain points you face in terms of device management and security compliance in your healthcare setting?
