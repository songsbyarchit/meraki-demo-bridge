Presenter: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for a demonstration of the Meraki MG, specifically tailored for the Healthcare sector. My name is [Name] and I will be guiding you through the next 30 minutes.

[Slide 1: Introduction to Meraki MG]
Presenter: Let's start by discussing the Meraki MG and its capabilities. The Meraki MG is a cloud-managed communication gateway that enables seamless voice communication and secure internet access. This is particularly crucial in the Healthcare sector, where reliable communication is essential for patient care.

[Slide 2: Use Case 1 - Telemedicine]
Presenter: One of the key use cases for the Meraki MG in Healthcare is telemedicine. With the increasing popularity of virtual consultations, healthcare providers need a reliable and secure communication solution to connect with patients remotely.

This not only saves time but also reduces operational costs.

[Slide 5: Smart Questions for Discussion]
Presenter: Before we wrap up, I'd like to pose a couple of questions for discussion:
1. How important is reliable communication and internet access in your healthcare facility?
2. What challenges have you faced in providing secure guest Wi-Fi access to visitors in the past?
3. How do you currently manage and monitor your communication and network infrastructure?
