Hello everyone and welcome to today's Meraki MT demo for the Finance sector. Today, we'll be focusing on partner enablement and supporting you in effectively pitching Meraki solutions to your customers. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Network Security]

Imagine a scenario where a financial institution needs to ensure the highest level of network security to protect sensitive customer data. With Meraki MT, partners can easily set up firewall rules to control traffic and prevent unauthorized access. 

**click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** 

Partners can create custom rules based on protocols, source/destination IP addresses, and more to tailor the security settings to the specific needs of the institution. This level of customization and control gives customers peace of mind knowing their network is secure.

[Use Case 2: Remote Workforce Management]

In today's remote work environment, many financial firms are faced with the challenge of managing a dispersed workforce. Meraki MT offers a solution by allowing partners to set up VPN connections easily and securely for remote employees.

**click 'Configure > Site-to-Site VPN'**

Partners can quickly deploy VPN tunnels to connect remote offices or individual users, ensuring secure access to the company network from anywhere. This seamless connectivity helps keep employees productive and connected, no matter where they are working from.

[Use Case 3: Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting]

For financial institutions, network downtime can result in significant financial losses. With Meraki MT, partners can proactively monitor their customers' networks and quickly troubleshoot any issues that arise.

**click 'Monitor > Network-wide > Clients'**

Partners can easily view client devices connected to the network, check their status, and identify any potential problems before they impact operations. This visibility and proactive approach to network management help ensure maximum uptime for financial institutions.
