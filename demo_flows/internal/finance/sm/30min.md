[Start of the demo]

Welcome everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki SM demo focused on the Finance sector. Today, we will be discussing how our solution can support partners in effectively pitching to customers in this industry.

Let's dive into our first use case. Imagine a financial institution with multiple branches across the country. With Meraki SM, partners can easily manage and secure all the devices in each branch remotely. This includes laptops, tablets, and mobile devices used by employees and customers. By **navigating to 'Systems Manager > Devices'**, partners can see real-time device status, enforce security policies, and troubleshoot any issues without needing physical access to the devices.

Now, let's move on to our second use case. In the finance sector, data security is paramount. With Meraki SM, partners can set up geofencing policies to ensure that sensitive financial data is only accessed within designated areas, such as the office premises or specific branch locations. By **clicking on 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'**, partners can easily configure geofencing rules to restrict data access based on device location.

Lastly, let's talk about compliance tracking. In the finance sector, regulatory compliance is a top priority. Meraki SM enables partners to track compliance across all devices and ensure that they meet industry standards. By **going to 'Systems Manager > Compliance'**, partners can view compliance reports, set up automated alerts for non-compliant devices, and take proactive measures to mitigate risks.

Now, let's end with a few smart questions that you can ask your customers during a pitch:

1. How are you currently managing and securing your devices across multiple branches?
2. What measures do you have in place to ensure data security and compliance within your organization?
3. Have you faced any challenges with remote device management and compliance tracking in the past?

Thank you for attending today's demo. We hope this session has empowered you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki SM to customers in the finance sector. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team.
