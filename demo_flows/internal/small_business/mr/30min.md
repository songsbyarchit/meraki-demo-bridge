[Opening]

Hello everyone and welcome to today's Meraki MR demo! Today, we'll be focusing on how you can effectively pitch the Meraki MR to small business customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Seamless Guest Wi-Fi]

One common pain point for small businesses is managing guest Wi-Fi access. With the Meraki MR, you can easily set up a separate guest network with a simple splash page for customers to log in. This can help businesses provide a seamless and secure Wi-Fi experience for their customers without compromising their internal network security.

To set this up, **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** and create a new SSID specifically for guests. You can then customize the splash page with the business's branding and set access controls to ensure security.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]

Another key feature of the Meraki MR is its ability to provide valuable insights through location analytics. Small businesses can use this data to understand customer behavior, foot traffic patterns, and optimize their marketing strategies.

To access this data, **click 'Monitor > Location analytics'**. Here, you can view metrics such as dwell time, repeat visits, and popular areas within the business premises. This information can help businesses make informed decisions to enhance the customer experience.

[Use Case 3: Remote Management]

Small businesses often have limited IT resources, making remote management a crucial aspect of their network infrastructure. With the Meraki MR, partners can offer businesses the ability to remotely monitor and troubleshoot their network from anywhere.

To demonstrate this, **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see a list of connected devices. From here, you can easily identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise without having to be on-site.

[Smart Questions to Prompt Discussion]

1. How do you currently handle guest Wi-Fi access for your customers? Have you faced any challenges in this area?
2. What kind of insights would be most valuable for your business to have access to through location analytics?
3. How important is remote management capability for your business, especially in terms of IT resource allocation?
