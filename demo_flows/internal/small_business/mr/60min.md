[Opening]

Welcome everyone to our Meraki MR demo for small businesses. Today, we'll be focusing on how our Meraki MR can benefit small businesses and how you, as our partners, can effectively pitch this solution to your customers.

[Use Case 1: Seamless Guest Wi-Fi]

Let's start with a common scenario for small businesses - providing seamless and secure guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up a guest network with splash pages and access controls. **Click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** to customize the guest network settings.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]

Another great feature of Meraki MR is location analytics. This can be a game-changer for small businesses looking to understand customer behavior and foot traffic. **Click 'Monitor > Location Analytics'** to see real-time data on customer movement within your premises.

[Use Case 3: Application Visibility]

Small businesses often struggle with network congestion due to bandwidth-heavy applications. With Meraki MR, you can easily monitor and control the applications running on your network. **Click 'Monitor > Application Visibility'** to see which applications are consuming the most bandwidth.

[Use Case 4: Easy Deployment and Management]

One of the key selling points of Meraki MR is its easy deployment and management. You can set up and configure multiple access points from a centralized dashboard. **Click 'Configure > Access Points > Add New'** to see how simple it is to add a new access point to your network.

[Smart Questions]

Now, let's wrap up with a couple of smart questions you can ask your customers:
1. How important is guest Wi-Fi access for your business, and how do you currently manage it?
2. Are you aware of the applications consuming the most bandwidth on your network, and how does this impact your business operations?

Remember, these questions can help you understand your customer's pain points and tailor your pitch accordingly.
