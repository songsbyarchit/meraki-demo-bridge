[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki SM demo focused on the Small Business sector. Today, we will be discussing how to effectively pitch Meraki SM to customers and enable our partners to succeed in the market. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Device Management]
Let's start with a common use case for small businesses - device management. With Meraki SM, you can easily enroll devices, push updates, and ensure all devices are secure and up to date. To demonstrate this, let's **navigate to 'Systems Manager > Manage > Devices'** where you can see all enrolled devices and their status.

[Use Case 2: Content Filtering]
Another important feature for small businesses is content filtering. With Meraki SM, you can easily set up policies to block certain websites or content categories to ensure a safe browsing experience for your employees. Let's **go to 'Systems Manager > Configure > Content filtering'** to set up a policy.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]
In the small business sector, remote troubleshooting is crucial to minimize downtime and keep operations running smoothly. With Meraki SM, you can remotely troubleshoot devices, push configurations, and resolve issues without having to be on-site. Let's **click 'Systems Manager > Monitor > Remote tools'** to see how this works.

[Use Case 4: Geofencing]
Geofencing is a powerful feature for small businesses to ensure devices are only used in designated areas. With Meraki SM, you can set up geofences and receive alerts when devices leave or enter a specific location. Let's **go to 'Systems Manager > Configure > Geofence'** to set up a geofence for a device.
