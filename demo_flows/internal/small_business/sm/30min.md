Demo Script:

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki SM demo targeted towards the Small Business sector. Today, we will focus on partner enablement and supporting you in pitching to customers effectively. 

Let's start by looking at a common use case for small businesses - managing device security. With Meraki SM, partners can easily deploy security policies across all devices from a centralized dashboard. Let me show you how simple it is to do this. 

**Click 'Systems Manager > Add a new security policy'**. Here, partners can set rules for device encryption, password requirements, and app permissions. This ensures that all devices are secure and compliant with company policies. 

Another use case that small businesses often face is managing software updates. With Meraki SM, partners can schedule and push software updates to all devices seamlessly. Let me demonstrate how easy it is to do this. 

**Click 'Systems Manager > Manage > Software Updates'**. Here, partners can view all available updates and schedule them to be pushed to devices outside of business hours, ensuring minimal disruption to operations. 

Now, let's talk about device tracking. Small businesses often have a limited number of devices and losing one can be costly. With Meraki SM, partners can track the location of all devices in real-time. Let me show you how this works. 

**Click 'Systems Manager > Devices > View device location'**. Partners can see the exact location of each device on a map, making it easy to locate lost or stolen devices quickly. 

Now, I have a few questions for you to prompt discussion:
1. How do you currently manage device security and software updates for your small business clients?
2. Have you ever faced challenges with tracking and locating devices in a small business environment?
3. How do you think Meraki SM can help you streamline device management for your small business clients?

Thank you for attending today's demo. I hope you found it helpful and informative. If you have any further questions or would like to explore Meraki SM further, please feel free to reach out to our team.
