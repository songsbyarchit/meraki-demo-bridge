Hello everyone, thank you for joining this Meraki MX demo session. Today, we will focus on how the Meraki MX can benefit small businesses and help our partners effectively pitch this solution to their customers.

Let's start by discussing the key features of the Meraki MX. It's an all-in-one security appliance that provides firewall, VPN, content filtering, and intrusion prevention capabilities in a single box. This makes it a cost-effective and easy-to-manage solution for small businesses.

Use Case 1: Secure Remote Access
Imagine a small business with employees working remotely. With the Meraki MX, they can easily set up secure VPN connections for their employees to access the company network from anywhere. This ensures that their data is protected, even when working outside the office.

To set up a VPN connection, you can simply **click 'Configure > VPN'** in the Meraki dashboard and follow the step-by-step instructions.

Use Case 2: Content Filtering
Small businesses often need to ensure that their employees are accessing appropriate websites during work hours. The Meraki MX allows them to set up content filtering rules to block access to certain websites or categories. This helps improve productivity and prevent security risks.

To set up content filtering, you can **click 'Configure > Content filtering'** in the Meraki dashboard and customize the rules according to the business needs.

Use Case 3: Intrusion Prevention
One of the biggest concerns for small businesses is cyber threats. The Meraki MX includes intrusion prevention capabilities to detect and block malicious traffic before it reaches the network. This provides an additional layer of security to protect the business from cyber attacks.

To enable intrusion prevention, you can **click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN > Threat protection'** in the Meraki dashboard and configure the settings accordingly.
