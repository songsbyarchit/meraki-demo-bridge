[Opening]

Welcome everyone to today's Meraki MT demo focused on the Small Business sector. Our goal today is to enable our partners with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively pitch Meraki solutions to their customers. 

Let's dive right in with our first use case.

[Use Case 1: Network Monitoring]

Imagine a small business owner who wants to monitor their network performance in real-time. With Meraki MT, they can easily **click 'Dashboard > Network Health'** to see an overview of their network status, including any connectivity issues or bandwidth usage. This visibility allows them to quickly troubleshoot and ensure their network is running smoothly.

[Use Case 2: Remote Troubleshooting]

Next, let's consider a scenario where a small business IT administrator needs to troubleshoot a network issue while working remotely. With Meraki MT, they can securely access the network from anywhere by **clicking 'Remote Tools > Dashboard API Access'**. This remote access capability streamlines the troubleshooting process and minimizes downtime for the business.

[Use Case 3: Guest Wi-Fi Management]

Now, let's discuss a common need for small businesses - guest Wi-Fi management. With Meraki MT, partners can easily set up a separate guest network by **clicking 'Configure > Wireless settings'**. This feature allows businesses to provide secure and seamless guest Wi-Fi access without compromising their main network.

[Use Case 4: Security Camera Integration]

In today's world, security is a top priority for businesses of all sizes. With Meraki MT, partners can seamlessly integrate security cameras into the network by **clicking 'Configure > Cameras'**. This integration allows businesses to monitor their premises in real-time and ensure the safety of their employees and assets.
