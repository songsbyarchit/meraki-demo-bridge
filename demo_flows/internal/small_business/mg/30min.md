Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MG demo focused on the Small Business sector. Today, we'll be discussing how partners can effectively pitch the Meraki MG to potential customers. Let's dive in!

First, let's talk about the key benefits of the Meraki MG for small businesses. One of the main advantages is its ease of management. With the Meraki dashboard, partners can easily configure and monitor the MG devices remotely, saving time and resources for small businesses.

Now, let's look at a use case. Imagine a small retail store that wants to offer guest Wi-Fi to its customers. With the Meraki MG, partners can easily set up a separate guest network and control access to ensure a secure connection for the business and its customers.

Another use case could be a small office environment that requires reliable VoIP services. The Meraki MG's Quality of Service (QoS) features allow partners to prioritize voice traffic, ensuring clear and uninterrupted communication for the business.

Now, let's discuss a third use case. For a small hotel or bed and breakfast, the Meraki MG can provide seamless connectivity for guests while also allowing the business owner to monitor and manage the network from anywhere. This level of control and visibility is crucial for small businesses looking to provide a reliable Wi-Fi experience for their guests.
