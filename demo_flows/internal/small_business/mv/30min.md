[Opening]
Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MV demo focused on the Small Business sector. Today, we'll be diving into the features and benefits of the Meraki MV cameras and how they can help our partners effectively pitch to customers. Let's get started!

[Use Case 1: Retail Store]
Imagine you're a small retail store owner concerned about theft and inventory management. With the Meraki MV cameras, you can easily monitor your store in real-time from anywhere using the intuitive dashboard. You can also set up motion-based alerts to notify you of any suspicious activity. To configure this, **click 'Camera settings > Motion alerts'**.

[Use Case 2: Office Security]
Now, let's consider a small office looking to enhance their security. With the Meraki MV cameras, you can set up virtual perimeters and receive alerts when someone enters a restricted area. This can help prevent unauthorized access and ensure the safety of your employees. To enable this feature, **click 'Camera settings > Video analytics'**.

[Use Case 3: Parking Lot Surveillance]
Lastly, let's look at a scenario where a small business owner wants to monitor their parking lot for safety and security. With the Meraki MV cameras, you can set up custom zones to focus on specific areas like entrance/exit points or blind spots. This can help prevent vandalism or theft incidents. To configure custom zones, **click 'Camera settings > Zones'**.
