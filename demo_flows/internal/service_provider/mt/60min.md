Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MT demo session. Today, we will focus on showcasing the capabilities of Meraki MT and how it can benefit our Service Provider partners in delivering efficient and reliable services to their customers. 

Let's start by looking at the dashboard and navigating to the device list. **Click 'Dashboard > Device List'** This view gives us an overview of all the Meraki MT devices deployed by our partners. 

[Use Case 1: Traffic Analysis]
One of the key features of Meraki MT is its ability to provide detailed traffic analysis. Let's dive into the traffic analytics section by **clicking 'Monitor > Traffic Analytics'**. Here, partners can see real-time insights into network traffic and usage patterns, helping them optimize their network performance and troubleshoot any issues quickly.

[Use Case 2: Quality of Service]
Another important use case for Service Providers is ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) for their customers. Let's navigate to the QoS settings by **clicking 'Configure > QoS'**. Partners can prioritize critical applications and ensure a consistent user experience across the network.

[Use Case 3: Network Segmentation]
Network segmentation is crucial for Service Providers to isolate customer traffic and maintain security. Let's explore the network segmentation feature by **clicking 'Configure > VLANs'**. Partners can easily create separate VLANs for different customers, enhancing network security and performance.

[Use Case 4: Remote Troubleshooting]
Remote troubleshooting is a common challenge for Service Providers. With Meraki MT, partners can remotely diagnose and resolve network issues. Let's demonstrate this by **clicking 'Tools > Remote Diagnostics'**. Partners can troubleshoot connectivity problems, reboot devices, and perform firmware updates without the need for onsite visits.
