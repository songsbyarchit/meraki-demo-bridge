[Opening]
Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MT demo specifically tailored for the Service Provider sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki MT solutions to your customers. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Network Monitoring]
Imagine you have a customer who needs real-time visibility into their network performance and security. With Meraki MT, you can easily set up monitoring dashboards to track network traffic, identify potential issues, and ensure optimal performance. **Navigate to 'Monitor > Live Tools' to show real-time data.**

[Use Case 2: Remote Troubleshooting]
Now, let's consider a scenario where your customer operates multiple branches and needs a solution for remote troubleshooting. Meraki MT allows you to remotely access devices, troubleshoot issues, and deploy updates without ever having to be physically on-site. **Demonstrate remote troubleshooting by clicking 'Systems Manager > Devices.'**

[Use Case 3: Scalable Network Expansion]
Lastly, let's talk about scalability. Many service providers face the challenge of expanding their network infrastructure to accommodate growth. With Meraki MT, you can easily add new devices, configure settings, and scale your network without disrupting operations. **Show how to add a new device by clicking 'Configure > Switch ports.'**
