[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining our Meraki MS demo today. Today, we will be focusing on how you as our partners in the Service Provider sector can effectively pitch Meraki MS solutions to your customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Simplified Network Management]
One of the key benefits of Meraki MS is its intuitive cloud-based dashboard that allows for easy network management. With just a few clicks, partners can **log in to the Meraki dashboard** and have full visibility and control over their customers' networks. This simplifies troubleshooting and reduces the need for on-site visits, saving time and resources.

[Use Case 2: Zero-touch provisioning]
Another powerful feature of Meraki MS is zero-touch provisioning. Partners can easily **add a new switch to the network** and have it automatically configured using predefined templates. This eliminates the need for manual configuration, making it easy to scale and deploy new devices quickly.

[Use Case 3: Network Monitoring and Alerts]
Meraki MS also offers robust network monitoring capabilities, allowing partners to **set up alerts for network issues** and proactively address them before they impact the customer's business. This not only improves network reliability but also helps partners demonstrate the value they bring to their customers.

[Use Case 4: Security and Compliance]
Security is a top priority for Service Providers and their customers. With Meraki MS, partners can easily **set up access control policies** and monitor network traffic to ensure compliance with industry regulations. This gives customers peace of mind knowing that their data is safe and secure.

[Discussion Questions]
1. How do you currently approach network management and troubleshooting with your customers?
2. What challenges do you face when it comes to scaling and deploying new network devices?
3. How important is network security and compliance to your customers, and how do you address these concerns?
