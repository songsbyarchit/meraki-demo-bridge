[Opening]
Hey everyone, thanks for joining today's Meraki SM demo focused on the Service Provider sector. We want to equip you with the tools and knowledge to effectively pitch Meraki SM to your customers. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Network Monitoring]
Imagine you're a service provider managing multiple client networks. With Meraki SM, you can easily monitor all your clients' networks from a single dashboard. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Overview'** to see real-time data on network health, device status, and client usage. This visibility allows you to proactively address any issues before they impact your clients' operations.

[Use Case 2: Remote Troubleshooting]
Let's say a client calls in with a connectivity issue. With Meraki SM, you can remotely troubleshoot the problem without having to dispatch a technician onsite. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** to see detailed device information and perform diagnostics. This not only saves time and resources but also improves customer satisfaction by resolving issues quickly.

[Use Case 3: Policy Management]
Now, let's talk about managing client policies. Service providers often need to enforce specific security and usage policies across multiple client networks. With Meraki SM, you can easily create and apply policies at scale. **Click 'Systems Manager > Configure > Policies'** to set up rules for device compliance, app usage, and content filtering. This centralized approach ensures consistent policy enforcement across all your clients.
