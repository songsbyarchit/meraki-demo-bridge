[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining this Meraki SM demo session today. Today, we'll be focusing on how Meraki SM can benefit the Retail sector and how our partners can effectively pitch this solution to their customers.

Let's dive into the demo with use case #1: Device Management for Point-of-Sale (POS) Systems.

[Use Case #1: Device Management for POS Systems]

Imagine you're a retail store manager with multiple POS systems across different locations. With Meraki SM, you can easily deploy, monitor, and update all your POS devices from one centralized dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see a list of all connected devices. You can remotely push software updates, troubleshoot issues, and ensure all devices are secure and up-to-date.

[Use Case #2: Employee Device Management]

In the retail sector, employees often use company-provided devices for tasks like inventory management, communication, and customer service. With Meraki SM, partners can offer their customers a solution to manage and secure these devices. **Click 'Systems Manager > Profiles'** to create profiles for different employee roles, setting restrictions and access permissions. This ensures that company data is protected and devices are used for work purposes only.

[Use Case #3: Customer Wi-Fi Experience]

Many retail stores offer free Wi-Fi to enhance the customer experience. With Meraki SM, partners can help retailers set up and manage secure guest Wi-Fi networks. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a separate guest network with limited access and bandwidth control. This not only provides a seamless Wi-Fi experience for customers but also protects the store's main network from potential security risks.

[Prompting Discussion]

Now, let's end with two or three smart questions you can use to prompt discussion with your customers:

1. How do you currently manage and secure your POS systems and employee devices across multiple locations?
2. What challenges have you faced in providing secure guest Wi-Fi access to customers in your retail store?
3. How important is remote device management and security to your overall business operations and customer experience?

Thank you for joining this demo session. We hope this has provided you with valuable insights on how Meraki SM can benefit the Retail sector and how you can effectively pitch this solution to your customers.
