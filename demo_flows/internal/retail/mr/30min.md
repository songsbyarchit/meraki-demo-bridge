Hello everyone and welcome to today's Meraki MR demo, focusing on the Retail sector. Today, we will be discussing how our Meraki MR solution can benefit retail businesses and how you can effectively pitch this to your customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Customer Engagement]

Imagine a retail store looking to enhance customer engagement. With Meraki MR, they can set up a guest Wi-Fi network for customers to easily connect to while shopping. This not only provides convenience but also allows the store to gather valuable data on customer behavior and preferences. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to see how easy it is to set up a guest network.

[Use Case 2: Inventory Management]

Now let's talk about inventory management. Retailers can use Meraki MR to track inventory in real-time using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. This allows them to monitor stock levels, track items, and even set up alerts for low inventory. **Click 'Wireless > Bluetooth'** to see how BLE technology can be integrated into the network.

[Use Case 3: Security]

Lastly, security is a top priority for retail businesses. With Meraki MR, retailers can ensure a secure network for both employees and customers. Features like built-in firewall, content filtering, and intrusion detection provide peace of mind against cyber threats. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to see how easy it is to configure security settings.
