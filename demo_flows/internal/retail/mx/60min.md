[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MX demo. Today, we will be focusing on how the Meraki MX can benefit the Retail sector and how our partners can effectively pitch this solution to their customers. Let's jump right in.

[Use Case 1: Secure Network Connectivity]

First, let's talk about secure network connectivity. In the retail sector, it's crucial to have a secure network to protect customer data and prevent any potential breaches. With the Meraki MX, partners can easily set up VPNs and firewall rules to ensure a secure connection for their retail clients. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN'** to see how easy it is to configure VPNs on the Meraki dashboard.

[Use Case 2: Traffic Shaping]

Next, let's discuss traffic shaping. In a retail environment, it's important to prioritize traffic for essential applications like POS systems and customer Wi-Fi. With the Meraki MX, partners can easily set up traffic shaping rules to ensure that critical applications have the bandwidth they need. **Click 'SD-WAN & traffic shaping'** to see how simple it is to configure traffic shaping rules on the dashboard.

[Use Case 3: Guest Wi-Fi]

Moving on to guest Wi-Fi. In retail, providing a seamless and secure guest Wi-Fi experience is key to enhancing the customer experience. With the Meraki MX, partners can easily set up a guest Wi-Fi network with splash pages and access controls to ensure a secure connection for their customers. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to see how easy it is to configure a guest Wi-Fi network on the dashboard.

[Use Case 4: Application Visibility]

Now, let's talk about application visibility. In retail, understanding which applications are consuming bandwidth is crucial for optimizing network performance. With the Meraki MX, partners can easily see real-time application usage and set up alerts for any unusual activity. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Application visibility'** to see how application visibility works on the dashboard.

[Prompt Questions]

Now that we've covered some key use cases, here are a few questions to prompt discussion with your retail customers:

1. How important is network security to your retail business, and what measures do you currently have in place to protect your network?
2. How does your current network handle traffic prioritization for different applications, and are there any pain points you would like to address in this area?
3. What insights do you currently have into your network's application usage, and how would improved visibility benefit your retail operations?
