Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MX demo focused on the Retail sector. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to effectively pitch Meraki MX to potential customers in the Retail industry.

Let's start by discussing a common use case in retail - secure connectivity for branch locations. With Meraki MX, we can provide a seamless and secure network connection for all branch locations, ensuring that sensitive customer data is protected at all times. **To set up secure connectivity for branch locations, we simply navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN' and configure the VPN settings.**

Another use case we often see in retail is network analytics and insights. With Meraki MX, we can provide real-time visibility into network traffic and performance, allowing retailers to make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and optimize operations. **To access network analytics and insights, navigate to 'Monitor > Appliance status' and view the dashboard.**

Now, let's talk about retail-specific features such as point-of-sale integration. Meraki MX can seamlessly integrate with existing point-of-sale systems, ensuring a smooth transaction process for customers and providing retailers with valuable data on sales and inventory. **To set up point-of-sale integration, navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall' and configure the firewall rules for the POS system.**

To prompt discussion, here are a few smart questions you can ask potential customers in the Retail sector:

1. How are you currently ensuring secure connectivity for your branch locations, and are you experiencing any challenges in this area?
2. How are you leveraging network analytics and insights to improve customer experience and operational efficiency in your retail stores?
3. Can you walk us through your current point-of-sale system and how it integrates with your network infrastructure?

By asking these questions, you can uncover pain points and demonstrate how Meraki MX can address their specific needs in the Retail sector. Thank you for your attention, and let's work together to empower our partners with the tools they need to succeed.
