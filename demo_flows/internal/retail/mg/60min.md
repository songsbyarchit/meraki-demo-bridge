Welcome everyone to today's Meraki MG demo! Today, we'll be focusing on how the Meraki MG can benefit retail businesses and how you, as partners, can effectively pitch this solution to your customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Secure Guest Wi-Fi]

To set this up, **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** and create a new SSID specifically for guests.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]
Another powerful feature of the Meraki MG is its ability to provide location analytics. This can be incredibly valuable for retail businesses to understand customer behavior, foot traffic patterns, and dwell times. To access this data, **click 'Location Analytics > Overview'**.

[Use Case 3: POS System Integration]
The Meraki MG also supports seamless integration with POS systems, making it easy for retail businesses to monitor and manage their transactions securely. To set this up, **click 'Security & SD-WAN > SD-WAN & traffic shaping'** and configure the rules for your POS system.

[Use Case 4: Remote Management]
For retail businesses with multiple locations, remote management is essential. The Meraki MG allows you to easily manage and monitor all your locations from a single dashboard. To do this, **click 'Monitor > Organization overview'** and select the location you want to manage.
