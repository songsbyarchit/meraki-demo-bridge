Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo. Whether you're a partner reseller, a customer IT admin, or an internal SE, I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki can revolutionize networking in the Manufacturing sector.

So, let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Manufacturing sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into some specific use cases for the Manufacturing sector:
1. **Real-time production monitoring**: See all your devices and equipment in one place for improved efficiency.
2. **Guest Wi-Fi for visitors**: Easily set up a separate network for visitors without compromising security.
3. **Inventory tracking with RFID**: Monitor inventory levels and movement with ease.
4. **Automated quality control**: Implement automated quality checks and alerts for seamless operations.
5. **Remote troubleshooting**: Quickly identify and resolve network issues without the need for on-site visits.
6. **Compliance reporting**: Simplify compliance reporting with detailed network insights.

Now, let's take a closer look at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for unified management:
- **Click 'Monitor > Clients' to view all connected devices**
- **Navigate to 'Configure > Wireless settings' to adjust network configurations**
- **Click 'Security > Firewall' to set up custom security rules**
- **Explore 'Switch > Port schedules' to manage device access times**
- **Check 'Systems manager > Device profiles' for endpoint management options**
- **Finally, click 'Dashboard > Overview' for a comprehensive look at network health**

And to wrap things up, here are a few FAQs to support partners selling MR in the Manufacturing space:
Q: What objections might the partner hear in manufacturing?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.
