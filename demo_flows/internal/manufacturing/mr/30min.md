Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MR solution can benefit the manufacturing sector.

Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from our partners about the trends and challenges you're seeing with customers in manufacturing. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

For our customers, could you share what your current network setup looks like and where your biggest IT headaches lie today?

And for our internal team, what common questions do our customers ask in the Manufacturing sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's focus on the specific needs of the Manufacturing sector. One key use case we see is real-time monitoring of production lines with our MR solution. **Click 'Wireless > Clients'** on the Dashboard to see how many devices are connected at each location.

Another use case is ensuring secure access for IoT devices on the factory floor. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Group Policies'** to create policies that segment traffic and protect critical assets.

Lastly, let's explore how Meraki Dashboard serves as a single pane of glass for visibility and management. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Access Points'** to see real-time performance metrics and **click 'Configure > SSIDs'** to quickly add a new network for guest access.

Now, let's address some FAQs to support our partners in selling MR to the Manufacturing sector:

Q: What objections might the partner hear in manufacturing?  
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?  
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?  
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thanks for joining me today. I hope this demo has given you a better understanding of how Cisco Meraki MR can benefit the Manufacturing sector. Let's go out there and empower our partners to pitch this solution effectively!
