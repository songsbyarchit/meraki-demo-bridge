[Opening]

Hello everyone, welcome to today's Meraki MR demo focused on the Manufacturing sector. Today, we'll be discussing how our Meraki MR solution can benefit manufacturing companies and how you can effectively pitch this solution to your customers. 

Let's start by discussing the unique challenges that manufacturing companies face when it comes to their network infrastructure. These companies often have large facilities with complex production processes that require a reliable and secure network to ensure smooth operations. 

[Use Case 1: Wireless Network Optimization]

One of the key use cases for Meraki MR in the manufacturing sector is optimizing the wireless network for seamless connectivity across the factory floor. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up multiple access points and create a mesh network that provides coverage in hard-to-reach areas. This helps ensure that workers can access critical applications and data no matter where they are in the facility. 

To demonstrate this, let's **log into the Meraki dashboard** and **navigate to the Wireless section**. Here, you can see all the access points in the network and **check the signal strength** in different areas of the facility. This allows you to easily identify any coverage gaps and make adjustments as needed to optimize the network performance. 

[Use Case 2: Network Security]

Another important use case for Meraki MR in the manufacturing sector is network security. Manufacturing companies often deal with sensitive data and intellectual property that needs to be protected from cyber threats. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up security policies and monitor network traffic to detect and prevent any unauthorized access. 

To demonstrate this, let's **navigate to the Security & SD-WAN section** in the Meraki dashboard. Here, you can see all the security settings and policies that have been configured for the network. You can also **view the security events** to see if any suspicious activity has been detected. This allows you to proactively address any security threats and ensure that your network remains secure. 

[Use Case 3: IoT Device Management]

Lastly, another use case for Meraki MR in the manufacturing sector is managing IoT devices. Many manufacturing companies rely on IoT devices to collect data and automate processes, but managing these devices can be a challenge. With Meraki MR, you can easily onboard and monitor IoT devices on the network, ensuring that they operate efficiently and securely. 

To demonstrate this, let's **navigate to the IoT section** in the Meraki dashboard. Here, you can see all the IoT devices that are connected to the network and **check their status**. You can also **set up alerts** to notify you of any issues with the devices, allowing you to quickly address them and minimize downtime. 

[Smart Questions]

Now that we've discussed some key use cases for Meraki MR in the manufacturing sector, here are a few smart questions you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing your wireless network in your manufacturing facility, and what challenges are you facing?
2. What measures do you have in place to ensure the security of your network and protect your sensitive data?
3. How are you leveraging IoT devices in your manufacturing processes, and how are you managing them on your network?
