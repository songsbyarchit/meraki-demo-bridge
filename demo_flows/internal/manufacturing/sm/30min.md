[Opening]

Presenter: Welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a demo of Meraki SM specifically tailored for the Manufacturing sector. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki SM to our manufacturing customers. Let's get started!

[Use Case 1: Device Management]

Presenter: One key use case for manufacturers is device management. With Meraki SM, we can easily enroll and manage all devices within a manufacturing facility from a single dashboard. Let's take a look at how this works.

**Click 'Systems Manager > Add devices'**

Presenter: Here, you can see all the devices that are connected to the network. From here, we can push updates, security policies, and even remotely wipe a device if it's lost or stolen. This level of control and visibility is crucial for ensuring operational efficiency and security in a manufacturing setting.

[Use Case 2: Network Security]

Presenter: Another use case that resonates with manufacturing customers is network security. With Meraki SM, we can easily enforce security policies across all devices to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.

**Click 'Systems Manager > Security policies'**

Presenter: Here, we can set up policies such as firewall rules, VPN configurations, and app restrictions to ensure that only approved devices and applications can access the network. This level of granular control is essential for maintaining a secure manufacturing environment.

[Use Case 3: Compliance Monitoring]

Presenter: Lastly, compliance monitoring is a critical aspect for manufacturers who need to adhere to industry regulations and standards. With Meraki SM, we can easily track and report on compliance metrics to ensure that all devices and systems are up to date and meeting regulatory requirements.

**Click 'Systems Manager > Compliance dashboard'**

Presenter: Here, we can see a comprehensive overview of compliance status across all devices, making it easy to identify any areas that need attention. This level of visibility and reporting is invaluable for manufacturers who need to demonstrate compliance to auditors and regulatory bodies.

[Prompting Discussion]

Presenter: Now that we've seen how Meraki SM can benefit manufacturing customers, let's discuss a few key questions that you can ask during your pitch:

1. How are you currently managing device security and compliance within your manufacturing facility?
2. What challenges have you faced with network management and security in the past?
3. How important is it for your organization to have a centralized platform for managing all devices and ensuring compliance?
