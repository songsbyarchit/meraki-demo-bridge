Hey there, thanks for joining us today! Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, we're excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's SM solution can revolutionize network management in the Manufacturing sector.

To kick things off, let's dive into the unique challenges and trends you're seeing in this space. What are some pain points your customers are facing, or what do you find particularly tricky about positioning solutions in Manufacturing?

Now, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard, your central platform for network management. With just a few **clicks**, you can gain visibility into your entire network, troubleshoot issues easily, and manage all your devices in one place.

Let's explore a couple of specific use cases in the Manufacturing sector. Imagine being able to quickly identify and resolve connectivity issues on the factory floor with just a **click** on the Dashboard. Or easily segmenting your network to ensure sensitive data stays secure â€” all from a single pane of glass.

Now, let's **navigate** to the Dashboard and see how you can streamline your network management tasks. You can easily **click 'Configure > VLANs'** to set up network segmentation tailored to your Manufacturing environment.

As you're pitching SM to customers in Manufacturing, you might encounter objections around cost compared to legacy vendors or skepticism towards cloud-managed security. Arm yourself with total cost of ownership comparisons to address these concerns effectively.

For partners selling in the Manufacturing space, we provide access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars. And post-sale, we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations through Meraki support.
