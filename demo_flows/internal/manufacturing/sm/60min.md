Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, we're excited to dive into how Cisco Meraki's SM solution can revolutionize networking in the Manufacturing sector. 

To kick things off, let's chat about the trends and challenges you're seeing in this space. What unique aspects or tricky situations have you encountered when positioning solutions to your customers?

Now, let's explore some key use cases tailored to Manufacturing:

1. **Real-time Production Monitoring**: Imagine having instant visibility into your production line's network health, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.
   
2. **Secure Access Control**: Easily manage user access permissions across different manufacturing areas, ensuring data security and compliance.
   
3. **Asset Tracking**: Track the location and status of valuable equipment in real-time, optimizing resource allocation and preventing theft.
   
4. **Guest Wi-Fi Management**: Provide secure guest Wi-Fi access for visitors without compromising your network's integrity.

Now, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for unified network management. **Click 'Dashboard'** to see how it provides a single pane of glass view for all your network devices.

With the Dashboard, you can **click 'Clients'** to quickly troubleshoot connectivity issues, **navigate to 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to set up secure Wi-Fi networks, and **go to 'Security & SD-WAN > Adaptive Policy'** to enforce granular security policies based on user roles.

As you engage with customers in Manufacturing, you may encounter objections like cost comparisons with legacy vendors and skepticism towards cloud-managed security. To address these concerns, provide them with TCO comparisons and case studies showcasing successful deployments in similar environments.

For partner enablement, we offer access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to enhance your pitching skills and product knowledge. And post-sale, we provide co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalation handling through Meraki support.

Let's empower your partners to thrive in the Manufacturing sector with Cisco Meraki's SM solution. Thanks for tuning in!
