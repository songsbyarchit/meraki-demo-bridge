[Opening]
Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki SM demo focusing on the Manufacturing sector. Our goal today is to enable our partners to effectively pitch Meraki solutions to manufacturing customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Secure Device Management]
Let's start with a common use case in manufacturing - managing a large number of IoT devices securely. With Meraki SM, partners can easily enroll, monitor, and secure these devices from a centralized dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Add new device'** to see how simple it is to onboard a new device.

[Use Case 2: Remote Troubleshooting]
In manufacturing, downtime is costly. With Meraki SM, partners can remotely troubleshoot devices, saving time and money. **Click 'Systems Manager > Remote desktop'** to see how you can quickly access and troubleshoot a device from anywhere.

[Use Case 3: Compliance Management]
Compliance is crucial in the manufacturing sector. With Meraki SM, partners can easily enforce security policies and ensure devices are compliant. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security policies'** to see how you can set up policies to meet regulatory requirements.

[Use Case 4: Asset Tracking]
Tracking assets in a manufacturing facility can be challenging. With Meraki SM, partners can easily track and manage assets using geolocation data. **Click 'Systems Manager > Location tracking'** to see how you can track assets in real-time.

[Prompt for Discussion]
Now that we've gone through some key use cases, I'd like to ask you all a couple of questions:
1. How do you currently manage device security in your manufacturing environment?
2. What challenges do you face in remote troubleshooting of devices?

[Closing]
Thank you for participating in today's demo. I hope you found it valuable in understanding how Meraki SM can benefit manufacturing customers. Remember, as partners, you have the opportunity to leverage these solutions to drive success for your customers.
