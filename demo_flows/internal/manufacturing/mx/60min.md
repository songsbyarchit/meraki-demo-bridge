Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo on Cisco Meraki MX, specifically tailored for the Manufacturing sector. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to walk you through how our solution can address the unique challenges faced in this industry.

To kick things off, let's discuss what trends or challenges you're currently seeing with customers in the Manufacturing sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's dive into the demo. Here are four strong use cases for the Manufacturing sector:

1. **Secure VPN Connectivity**: Easily set up and manage secure VPN connections between different manufacturing facilities for seamless communication.
   
2. **Network Segmentation**: Implement network segmentation to isolate critical systems, such as production lines, from other parts of the network to enhance security.

3. **Application Visibility**: Gain insights into network traffic to identify bandwidth-hungry applications and prioritize critical processes for optimal performance.

4. **Automated Alerts**: Configure automated alerts for network anomalies or security breaches to proactively address issues before they escalate.

Now, let's explore the Meraki Dashboard, our centralized platform for visibility, troubleshooting, and management. **Click on 'Network-wide > Clients'** to view all connected devices and their statuses.

Next, let's **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security Center'** to review security policies and threat protection settings.

Moving on, let's **navigate to 'Switching > Switch ports'** to manage and optimize network connectivity within the manufacturing environment.

Lastly, let's **explore 'Wireless > Wireless Health'** to monitor the performance of wireless access points and ensure seamless connectivity for all devices.
