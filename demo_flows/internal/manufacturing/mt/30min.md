[Start of Demo]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MT demo focused on the Manufacturing sector. Today, we will be looking at how Meraki MT can benefit manufacturing environments and support our partners in effectively pitching to customers. 

Let's start by looking at the first use case - real-time monitoring of production lines. With Meraki MT, partners can easily set up sensors to monitor the performance of machines on the production line. This can help identify any issues or inefficiencies in real-time, allowing for quick intervention to minimize downtime and increase productivity. To set this up, partners can **click 'Configure > Sensor monitoring'** to access the dashboard and view real-time data.

The second use case we will explore is asset tracking. In manufacturing environments, it is crucial to keep track of valuable assets such as machinery, tools, and inventory. With Meraki MT, partners can deploy asset tracking tags and use the dashboard to monitor the location and movement of assets in real-time. This can help improve inventory management, prevent loss, and optimize asset utilization. Partners can **click 'Configure > Asset tracking'** to set up and monitor asset tracking.

Moving on to the last use case - environmental monitoring. Manufacturing facilities often have strict environmental regulations to adhere to. With Meraki MT, partners can deploy environmental sensors to monitor factors such as temperature, humidity, and air quality. This data can help ensure compliance with regulations, maintain optimal working conditions, and prevent damage to sensitive equipment. Partners can **click 'Configure > Environmental monitoring'** to set up and monitor environmental sensors.

Now that we have seen how Meraki MT can benefit manufacturing environments, let's end with two smart questions that partners can ask customers to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently monitor the performance of your production lines and assets in your manufacturing facility?
2. What environmental factors are most critical for your manufacturing processes, and how do you currently monitor and control them?

Thank you for attending today's demo. We hope this session has provided valuable insights into how Meraki MT can support manufacturing environments and empower our partners to pitch effectively to customers. If you have any further questions or would like to explore Meraki MT further, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
