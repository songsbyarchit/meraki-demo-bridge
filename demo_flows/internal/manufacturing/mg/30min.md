Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MG can revolutionize network management in the Manufacturing sector.

To kick things off, let's dive into your world a bit. For partners, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's explore how the Meraki Dashboard can address these needs. **Click 'Dashboard'** and you'll see how it provides a single pane of glass for visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management.

Imagine a scenario where a Manufacturing plant is struggling with network downtime. With MG, **click 'Clients' > 'Client list'** to quickly identify the problematic device and **click 'Tools' > 'Ping'** to troubleshoot in real-time.

Another use case could be a Manufacturing company expanding to a new facility. **Click 'Network-wide' > 'Configure'** to easily replicate network settings across all sites, ensuring consistency and security.

Lastly, let's look at how MG enhances security in Manufacturing. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN' > 'Security policies'** to implement granular policies based on device types, ensuring compliance and protection against cyber threats.

Now, let's tackle some common FAQs for partners selling MG in Manufacturing:
Q: What objections might the partner hear in manufacturing?
