Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to dive into how Cisco Meraki MV can revolutionize the way we approach network security in the Manufacturing sector.

Let's start by discussing the trends and challenges you're seeing with your customers in this space. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in Manufacturing?

Now, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for unified management. With a single pane of glass, you can gain visibility into your entire network, simplify troubleshooting, and manage everything from one place.

One key use case in Manufacturing is using MV cameras for real-time monitoring of production lines. With **click 'Cameras > Live View'**, you can keep an eye on operations and ensure everything is running smoothly.

Another use case is enhancing warehouse security with MV smart cameras. By **clicking 'Security > Video Settings'**, you can easily configure motion detection and notifications to keep your assets safe.

Lastly, let's explore using MV cameras for quality control inspections. By **navigating to 'Analytics > Object Detection'**, you can set up alerts for anomalies and improve your production processes.

Now, let's address some common questions in the Manufacturing sector:
- What objections might partners hear in manufacturing? Cost vs. legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security. Arm them with TCO comparisons.
- What enablement do we provide for partners? Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.
- How do we support onboarding post-sale? We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast Meraki support escalations.
