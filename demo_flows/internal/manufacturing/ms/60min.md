Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to walk you through how Cisco Meraki's MS can revolutionize networking in the Manufacturing sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Manufacturing sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into the demo focusing on the needs of the Manufacturing sector. Here are some key use cases where MS shines:
1. **Monitoring production line connectivity**
2. **Ensuring device security and compliance**
3. **Remote troubleshooting for distributed facilities**
4. **Optimizing network performance for IIoT devices**
5. **Implementing guest networks for factory tours**
6. **Enabling secure access for BYOD devices**

Throughout this demo, keep an eye on the Meraki Dashboard as our central platform. It provides a single pane of glass for visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management. Let's **click 'Dashboard'** to get started.

Now, let's **click 'Devices > Switches'** to see how easy it is to manage and monitor all switches from one place. You can quickly identify any issues and make necessary configurations without jumping between different interfaces.

Next, let's **click 'Clients'** to check on the devices connected to the network. With real-time insights, you can easily troubleshoot any connectivity issues and ensure smooth operations on the factory floor.

Moving on, let's **click 'Network-wide > Alerts'** to see how the dashboard proactively notifies you of any potential issues, allowing you to address them before they impact production.

Lastly, let's **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security Center'** to explore how Meraki simplifies security management, including firewall rules, content filtering, and intrusion prevention, all from one intuitive interface.

To support our partners in selling MS to the Manufacturing sector, here are a few FAQs:
- Q: What objections might the partner hear in manufacturing?
  A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.
  
- Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
  A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.
  
- Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
  A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.
