[Opening]

Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MS demo focusing on the Manufacturing sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki MS solutions to our manufacturing customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility and Control]

Presenter: One of the key challenges in manufacturing is ensuring network reliability and security. With Meraki MS, we offer a centralized dashboard that provides real-time visibility into the network. From here, partners can easily **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to monitor and control network traffic. This level of control is crucial in maintaining operational efficiency and minimizing downtime in manufacturing facilities.

[Use Case 2: Plug-and-Play Deployment]

Presenter: Another pain point for manufacturing customers is the complexity of network deployment. With Meraki MS, we offer a plug-and-play solution that streamlines the deployment process. Partners can **click 'Configure > Add a switch'** to quickly add new devices to the network without the need for manual configuration. This feature not only saves time but also reduces the risk of human error during deployment.

[Use Case 3: Network Segmentation]

Presenter: Security is a top priority for manufacturing companies, especially when it comes to protecting sensitive data and intellectual property. With Meraki MS, partners can easily **click 'Configure > VLANs'** to segment the network and create isolated zones for different departments or applications. This level of network segmentation enhances security measures and ensures that critical data remains protected.

[Smart Questions]

Presenter: Now, I'd like to pose a couple of questions to prompt discussion:
1. How has network visibility and control impacted your manufacturing operations in the past?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face when it comes to network deployment and management in your manufacturing facilities?
3. In what ways do you currently segment your network to enhance security measures?

[Closing]
