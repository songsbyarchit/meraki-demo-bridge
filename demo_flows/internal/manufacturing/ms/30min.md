Hey there, thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner looking to better serve your manufacturing customers, a customer IT admin seeking new solutions, or an internal SE wanting to understand the challenges in this sector, this demo is tailored just for you.

Let's kick things off with a quick question:
For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the manufacturing sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into the Meraki MS and how it can revolutionize networking in the manufacturing sector.

**Use Case 1: Enhancing Visibility**
Imagine being able to see all your network devices in one place, easily identifying and troubleshooting any issues. With the Meraki Dashboard, you can **click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** to get a comprehensive view of all connected devices.

**Use Case 2: Simplified Troubleshooting**
In manufacturing, downtime is costly. The Meraki Dashboard allows you to quickly pinpoint network problems. Let's **click 'Switch > Monitor > Switch ports'** to identify any connectivity issues.

**Use Case 3: Unified Management**
Managing a complex network can be overwhelming. With Meraki, you can streamline operations by **clicking 'Configure > VLANs'** to easily set up and manage VLANs across your manufacturing environment.

Now, let's address some common questions for partners selling MS in manufacturing:

Q: What objections might the partner hear in manufacturing?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.
