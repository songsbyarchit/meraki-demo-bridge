Welcome everyone to today's Meraki MS demo focused on the K12 sector. Today, we will be highlighting how partners can effectively pitch Meraki MS solutions to K12 customers. Let's dive in.

First, let's talk about the key benefits of Meraki MS for the K12 sector. Meraki MS offers simple, centralized management, making it easy for IT staff in schools to monitor and manage their network. This can help schools save time and resources, allowing them to focus on providing a better learning experience for students.

Use Case 1: Network Visibility
Let's start by showcasing the network visibility feature of Meraki MS. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see a real-time view of all the devices connected to the network. This can be particularly useful for schools to monitor student devices and ensure they are using the network appropriately.

Use Case 2: Application Control
Next, let's explore the application control feature of Meraki MS. **Click 'Configure > Firewall & traffic shaping'** to see how schools can prioritize educational applications over non-educational ones. This can help schools ensure that bandwidth is allocated efficiently, especially during peak usage times.

Use Case 3: Smart Port Configuration
Lastly, let's look at the smart port configuration feature of Meraki MS. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to see how partners can easily configure ports based on specific device requirements. This can help schools streamline their network setup and ensure that each device receives the appropriate network settings.

Now, let's move on to some key questions that partners can ask K12 customers to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing your network in the school environment? Are there any pain points or challenges you are facing?
2. What are the key applications or devices that are critical for the learning experience in your school? How are you ensuring that they receive priority on the network?
3. How important is network visibility and control for you in managing the school network effectively?
