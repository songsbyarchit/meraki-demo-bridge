[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining this Meraki MG demo session today. Our focus today is on partner enablement, specifically targeting the K12 sector. We want to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch the Meraki MG to your customers in the education industry. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Remote Learning]

Imagine a scenario where a school district needs to provide reliable and secure internet connectivity for remote learning. With the Meraki MG, partners can easily set up a secure VPN connection to ensure students and teachers can access online resources without any interruptions. **Click 'Configure > Site-to-Site VPN'** to see how simple it is to configure.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi for Events]

Now let's consider a use case where a school is hosting a large event and needs to provide guest Wi-Fi access. With the Meraki MG, partners can set up a separate guest network with bandwidth limits to ensure a smooth experience for all attendees. **Click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** to see how easy it is to create a guest network.

[Use Case 3: Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting]

Lastly, let's talk about network monitoring and troubleshooting. The Meraki MG provides partners with real-time visibility into network performance, allowing them to proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see how partners can easily monitor network activity.

[Discussion Questions]

Now, let's open up the floor for discussion. Here are a few smart questions you can ask your potential customers:

1. How important is network security for your school district, especially with the rise of remote learning?
2. Have you experienced any challenges with providing reliable Wi-Fi access during events or large gatherings?
3. How do you currently monitor and troubleshoot network issues, and what improvements would you like to see in this area?
