Hey there, thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to walk you through a demo of our Cisco Meraki MG solution tailored for the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector.

To kick things off, I'd love to hear from our partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's dive in and explore how Meraki MG can address these challenges with some specific use cases:

1. **Remote Learning Support**: With the increase in remote learning, Meraki MG ensures reliable connectivity for students and teachers, even from home.

2. **Content Filtering and Security**: Protect students from accessing harmful content while ensuring a secure online environment.

3. **Device Management**: Simplify the management of a large number of devices across multiple campuses with centralized control.

4. **Bandwidth Management**: Prioritize critical applications like educational tools over recreational ones to optimize network performance.

Now, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for unified management and troubleshooting:
