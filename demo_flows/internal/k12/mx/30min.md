Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this Cisco Meraki demo focused on the MX product line, specifically tailored for the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector.

Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from our partners in the audience. What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great insights, thank you. Now, let's explore how the Meraki MX can address these needs. Imagine a school district struggling with network security, content filtering, and remote learning capabilities. With Meraki MX, we can provide a secure, reliable network that offers content filtering for educational purposes, seamless integration with remote learning tools, and advanced security features to protect student data.

Let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard now. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'** to see how easy it is to set up content filtering policies tailored to educational needs. And **click 'Monitor > Appliance status'** to quickly troubleshoot any network issues that may arise.

Another use case could be a primary school looking to simplify network management across multiple campuses. With Meraki MX, they can achieve unified network management through the Dashboard, ensuring consistent policies and configurations across all locations. **Click 'Configure > Site-to-site VPN'** to see how easy it is to connect all campuses securely.

Lastly, let's consider a K-12 school facing budget constraints but needing to upgrade their network infrastructure. Meraki MX offers a cost-effective solution with cloud-managed security, reducing the need for on-premise hardware and maintenance costs. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security policies'** to see how easy it is to configure security policies across all devices.

Now, let's address some common questions and objections partners may encounter in the K-12 Education/Primary Education space:
Q: What objections might the partner hear in K-12 education/primary education?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thank you for joining us today. We hope this demo has equipped you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki MX to customers in the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector.
