Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo focused on Cisco Meraki's SM solution in the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, the goal here is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch our solutions in this space.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Moving on, let's dive into the Meraki Dashboard, the heart of our SM solution. This single pane of glass provides unparalleled visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management. **Click 'Dashboard'** to explore real-time insights into your network health.

Now, let's explore two key use cases in the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector:
1. **Click 'Clients' to see a detailed breakdown of device activity across your network, helping you identify any potential security risks or performance issues.**
2. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Security Center' to set up firewall rules and VPN connections, ensuring a secure and reliable network environment for your students and staff.**

As you engage with customers in this sector, you may encounter objections such as cost vs. legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. Arm yourself with TCO comparisons to address these concerns effectively.

Additionally, we provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to support your sales efforts. Post-sale onboarding is equally crucial, and we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations handling by our dedicated Meraki support team.

That wraps up our demo for today. Thank you for your time, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way in selling SM in the K-12 Education/Primary Education space. Happy pitching!
