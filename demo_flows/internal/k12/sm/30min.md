[Opening]

Welcome everyone to today's Meraki SM demo focused on the K12 sector. Our goal today is to equip our partners with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively pitch Meraki SM to their customers in the education industry. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Device Management]
One common use case in K12 schools is managing a large number of devices, such as tablets or laptops, used by students and staff. With Meraki SM, partners can easily enroll new devices, push apps and updates, and ensure compliance with school policies. **Click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see an overview of all managed devices in the school network. Partners can highlight how Meraki SM simplifies the device management process and improves efficiency for IT administrators.

[Use Case 2: Content Filtering]
Another important feature for K12 schools is content filtering to ensure a safe and secure online environment for students. **Click 'Systems Manager > Content filtering'** to show how partners can set up policies to block inappropriate websites or content on school devices. This use case demonstrates how Meraki SM helps schools enforce internet safety policies and protect students from harmful online content.

[Use Case 3: Location Tracking]
For schools with large campuses, location tracking can be a valuable tool for asset management and security. **Click 'Systems Manager > Location tracking'** to demonstrate how partners can track the real-time location of school devices and set up geofencing alerts. This use case showcases how Meraki SM enhances school security measures and improves the overall management of school resources.
