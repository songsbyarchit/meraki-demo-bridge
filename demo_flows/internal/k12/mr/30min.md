Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's MR solution, tailored specifically for the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector.

To kick things off, let's start by discussing some trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're an IT admin at a primary school. You log into the Meraki Dashboard and immediately see all your MR access points in one place. **Click 'Wireless > Access Points'**.

Here, you can easily monitor network usage, see which devices are connected, and identify any potential issues. This level of visibility is crucial in ensuring a smooth learning experience for students.

Next, let's explore a specific use case. Let's say a classroom is experiencing slow internet speeds. With Meraki, troubleshooting is a breeze. **Click 'Wireless > Clients'** to identify the device causing the congestion and quickly resolve the issue.

Now, let's talk about security. In the education sector, protecting student data is paramount. With Meraki, you can easily set up robust security policies to keep sensitive information safe. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Configure > Firewall'** to see how simple it is to customize security settings.

As an internal SE, you may often encounter questions about how Meraki can address specific needs in the K-12 Education sector. The Meraki Dashboard acts as a single pane of glass for managing all your network devices, making it easy to streamline operations and ensure a secure learning environment.

Lastly, let's touch on some FAQs to support partners selling MR in this space:
