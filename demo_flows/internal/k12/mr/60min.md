[Opening]

Welcome everyone to today's Meraki MR demo! Today, we'll be focusing on how our Meraki MR solution can benefit the K12 sector. Our goal is to equip our partners with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively pitch this solution to customers. 

Let's dive right in with our first use case.

[Use Case 1: Seamless Classroom Connectivity]

Imagine a classroom full of students trying to connect to the school's Wi-Fi network. With Meraki MR, setting up a secure and reliable network is a breeze. Simply **log into the Meraki dashboard**, **click 'Wireless > Access points'**, and **add a new access point**. The system will automatically configure itself, ensuring that every student has a fast and stable connection.

[Use Case 2: Guest Access Management]

Many K12 schools host events where guests need temporary access to the Wi-Fi network. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up a separate guest network with limited access. **Navigate to 'Wireless > SSIDs'**, **create a new SSID for guests**, and **set up a splash page for authentication**. This way, you can provide seamless connectivity for guests without compromising security.

[Use Case 3: Location Analytics for School Safety]

In today's world, school safety is a top priority. With Meraki MR, you can leverage location analytics to track the movement of devices within the school premises. This can be invaluable during emergencies or for monitoring student attendance. **Navigate to 'Wireless > Clients'**, and **view the real-time location of devices** on the map.

[Use Case 4: Application Visibility and Control]

As a K12 school, it's important to ensure that students are using the network responsibly. With Meraki MR, you can easily monitor and control the applications being used on the network. **Navigate to 'Wireless > Application visibility'**, and **set up policies to block specific applications**. This helps in maintaining a safe and productive learning environment.

[Prompting Discussion]

Now that we've explored some key use cases, here are a few questions to consider:

1. How can the seamless connectivity provided by Meraki MR enhance the learning experience for students?
2. In what ways can the location analytics feature be utilized to improve school safety measures?
