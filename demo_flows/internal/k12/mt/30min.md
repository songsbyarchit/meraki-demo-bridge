Hey there, thanks for joining us today! I'm excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki and how our solutions can benefit K-12 Education/Primary Education. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from our partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

**Use Case 1: Classroom Connectivity**
Let's start by taking a look at the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Wireless > Access points'** to see how easy it is to manage multiple access points across different classrooms. With just a few clicks, you can ensure seamless connectivity for students and teachers alike.

**Use Case 2: Security and Content Filtering**
Next, let's explore how we can enhance security in schools. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'** to set up policies that restrict access to harmful or distracting websites. This feature not only keeps students safe but also helps in maintaining a focused learning environment.

**Use Case 3: Remote Learning Support**
Given the current landscape, many schools are adopting remote learning. **Click 'VPN > Client VPN'** to see how easily teachers and staff can securely access the network from anywhere. This ensures that learning can continue uninterrupted, no matter where the students or teachers are.

Now, let's address some FAQs to better equip our partners:
Q: What objections might the partner hear in K-12 Education/Primary Education?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.
