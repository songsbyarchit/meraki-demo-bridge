[Opening]
Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MT demo focused on the K12 sector. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki solutions to K12 customers. Let's get started!

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility]
One of the key features of Meraki MT is its ability to provide comprehensive network visibility. With just a few clicks, you can **navigate to the dashboard and view real-time network activity**. This is crucial for K12 institutions to monitor student and staff device usage, identify potential security threats, and ensure smooth network performance. 

[Use Case 2: Remote Management]
Meraki MT allows for seamless remote management of network devices. **Click 'Devices > Select a device > Remote Tools'** to troubleshoot issues or make configuration changes without the need for on-site visits. This is especially helpful for K12 schools with limited IT resources and dispersed campuses.

[Use Case 3: Content Filtering]
Content filtering is essential for K12 institutions to protect students from accessing inappropriate content online. With Meraki MT, you can easily **set up content filtering policies by clicking 'Security & SD-WAN > Content Filtering'**. This ensures a safe and secure browsing experience for students while they are on the school network.

[Use Case 4: Application Prioritization]
In a K12 environment, it's important to prioritize educational applications to ensure seamless access for students and teachers. **Navigate to 'Wireless > Application Visibility'** to identify and prioritize critical applications like learning management systems or video conferencing tools. This helps optimize network performance and enhance the overall learning experience.

[Prompt for Discussion]
Now that we've covered some key use cases, I want to hear from you. How do you think Meraki MT can address the unique networking challenges faced by K12 schools? 

[Use Case 5: Guest Access]
K12 schools often host events or meetings where external guests need access to the network. With Meraki MT, you can easily **set up a guest network by clicking 'Wireless > SSIDs > Add a new SSID'**. This allows guests to connect securely without compromising the main school network.

[Use Case 6: Device Management]
Managing a large number of devices in a K12 environment can be overwhelming. Meraki MT simplifies device management with features like **'Systems Manager > Devices > Add new device'**. This streamlines the process of onboarding and monitoring devices, ensuring optimal performance across the network.

[Prompt for Discussion]
As you think about your K12 customers, how do you see Meraki MT improving their network management and overall efficiency?
