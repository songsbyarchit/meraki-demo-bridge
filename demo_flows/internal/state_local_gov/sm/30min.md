[Overview of Meraki SM]

- Meraki SM is a cloud-based mobile device management solution that provides centralized management and control of mobile devices.
- It allows partners to easily deploy, secure, and monitor devices across multiple locations, making it ideal for State Local Gov organizations with distributed teams.

[Use Case 1: Device Deployment]

- Imagine a State Local Gov agency that needs to deploy new tablets to field workers. With Meraki SM, partners can easily push out configurations and apps to these devices remotely.
- **Navigate to 'Systems Manager > Devices' to see a list of all managed devices.**
- Partners can ensure all devices are properly set up and secured, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]

- State Local Gov organizations handle sensitive data that must comply with strict security regulations. Meraki SM helps partners ensure devices are compliant with security policies.
- **Go to 'Systems Manager > Security Policies' to set up compliance rules for devices.**
- Partners can monitor and enforce security settings like encryption, passcode requirements, and app restrictions to keep data safe.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]

- When issues arise with devices in the field, partners can use Meraki SM to troubleshoot remotely, saving time and resources.
- **Click 'Systems Manager > Remote Desktop' to access a device remotely and troubleshoot issues.**
- Partners can quickly resolve problems without the need for costly onsite visits, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.
