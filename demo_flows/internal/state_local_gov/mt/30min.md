[Opening]

Presenter: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's Meraki MT demo. Today, we'll be focusing on how we can support our partners in the State Local Gov sector to effectively pitch Meraki solutions to their customers. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility]

Presenter: One key use case that our partners can highlight to State Local Gov customers is the network visibility that Meraki MT provides. With just a few clicks, partners can **navigate to the Dashboard** and see a real-time view of the network, including connected devices, traffic patterns, and potential security threats. This level of visibility is crucial for government agencies to ensure the security and performance of their networks.

[Use Case 2: Remote Management]

Presenter: Another use case that partners can emphasize is the remote management capabilities of Meraki MT. By **clicking 'Configure > Switch ports'**, partners can remotely manage and troubleshoot network devices without the need for on-site visits. This is especially important for government agencies with multiple locations or limited IT resources, as it allows them to quickly address issues and ensure network uptime.

[Use Case 3: Security Compliance]

Presenter: Lastly, partners can showcase how Meraki MT helps State Local Gov agencies maintain security compliance. By **clicking 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'**, partners can easily set up content filtering policies to block malicious websites and ensure compliance with government regulations. This level of security is essential for protecting sensitive data and preventing cyber attacks.

[Smart Questions]

Presenter: Now, let's wrap up with a few smart questions that partners can ask their customers to prompt discussion. First, partners can ask, "How important is network visibility in ensuring the security and performance of your agency's network?" This question can help partners understand the specific needs and priorities of the customer.

Presenter: Second, partners can ask, "How do you currently manage and troubleshoot network devices across multiple locations?" This question can uncover any pain points or inefficiencies in the customer's current network management processes.

Presenter: Lastly, partners can ask, "What security compliance requirements does your agency need to adhere to, and how are you currently addressing them?" This question can help partners tailor their pitch to the customer's specific compliance needs and demonstrate how Meraki MT can help meet those requirements.
