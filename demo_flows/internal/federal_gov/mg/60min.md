[Opening]
Presenter: Good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to dive into a demo of the Meraki MG, focusing on how it can benefit our partners in the Federal Gov sector. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch this solution to our customers. Let's get started.

[Use Case 1: Secure Connectivity]
Presenter: One key use case for the Meraki MG in the Federal Gov sector is secure connectivity. With its built-in VPN capabilities, the MG ensures that data transmission is encrypted and secure. Let's **navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN'** in the dashboard to see how easy it is to set up secure connections for remote locations or teleworkers.

[Use Case 2: Quality of Service (QoS) for Voice and Video]
Presenter: Another important use case is ensuring quality of service for voice and video traffic. The Meraki MG allows us to prioritize traffic based on application type, ensuring that critical communications are not affected by other network traffic. Let's **go to 'Traffic Shaping'** in the dashboard to see how we can configure QoS policies.

[Use Case 3: Remote Management and Troubleshooting]
Presenter: In the Federal Gov sector, remote management and troubleshooting are crucial. The Meraki MG offers cloud-based management, allowing us to monitor and troubleshoot devices from anywhere. Let's **click 'Devices > MG'** in the dashboard to see real-time device status and performance metrics.

[Use Case 4: Redundancy and Failover]
Presenter: Redundancy and failover are key considerations for government agencies. The Meraki MG supports redundant WAN connections and failover capabilities, ensuring continuous connectivity even in the event of a network outage. Let's **navigate to 'Uplink Configuration'** in the dashboard to see how we can configure failover settings.

[Prompting Questions]
Presenter: Now, before we wrap up, I'd like to ask you all a couple of questions to prompt some discussion. How do you currently address secure connectivity and QoS for voice and video traffic in your network? And, what challenges have you faced with remote management and troubleshooting in your current network setup?

[Closing]
