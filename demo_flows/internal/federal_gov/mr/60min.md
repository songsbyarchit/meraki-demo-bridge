[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MR demo focused on the Federal Gov sector. Today, we will be looking at how our Meraki MR solution can meet the unique needs of government agencies and how our partners can effectively pitch this solution to their customers. 

[Slide 1: Introduction to Meraki MR]
Let's start by giving a brief overview of the Meraki MR solution. Meraki MR is a cloud-managed wireless solution that provides secure, reliable, and high-performance connectivity for organizations of all sizes. With features like seamless roaming, centralized management, and advanced security capabilities, Meraki MR is the ideal choice for government agencies looking to modernize their network infrastructure.

[Slide 2: Use Case 1 - Secure Access Control]
One of the key use cases for government agencies is secure access control. With Meraki MR, agencies can easily set up role-based access control policies to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information. Partners can demonstrate this by **navigating to 'Access control' in the dashboard and creating a new policy for a specific user group.**

[Slide 3: Use Case 2 - Location Analytics]
Another important use case for government agencies is location analytics. Meraki MR provides real-time insights into user behavior and foot traffic, allowing agencies to optimize their space utilization and improve operational efficiency. Partners can showcase this feature by **clicking 'Location analytics' in the dashboard and generating a report on user activity in a specific area.**

[Slide 4: Use Case 3 - Guest Access]
Government agencies often need to provide guest access to external partners or visitors. With Meraki MR, agencies can easily set up a secure guest network with customized splash pages and access controls. Partners can demonstrate this by **clicking 'Wireless > Guest access' in the dashboard and creating a new guest network with a custom splash page.**

[Slide 5: Use Case 4 - Application Visibility]
Government agencies rely on a wide range of applications to carry out their mission-critical tasks. Meraki MR offers deep packet inspection and application visibility, allowing agencies to monitor and prioritize traffic based on application type. Partners can showcase this by **navigating to 'Wireless > Application visibility' in the dashboard and setting up QoS policies for specific applications.**

[Slide 6: Use Case 5 - Mesh Networking]
In remote or temporary government facilities, setting up a wired network infrastructure can be challenging. Meraki MR's mesh networking capabilities allow agencies to extend their network coverage without the need for additional cabling. Partners can demonstrate this by **clicking 'Wireless > Mesh' in the dashboard and adding a new mesh node to the network.**

[Slide 7: Use Case 6 - Threat Detection]
Security is a top priority for government agencies, and Meraki MR offers advanced threat detection capabilities to protect against cyber threats. Partners can showcase this feature by **navigating to 'Security > Threat detection' in the dashboard and monitoring for any suspicious activity on the network.**

[Closing]

In conclusion, Meraki MR is a powerful solution that can help government agencies improve their network performance, security, and user experience. As partners, it's important to understand the unique needs of government customers and tailor our pitch accordingly.
