[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MR demo focused on the Federal Gov sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki MR to our government customers.

Let's start by looking at the Meraki MR dashboard. **Log in to your Meraki dashboard and navigate to the Wireless section**. This dashboard provides a centralized view of all your Meraki MR access points, making it easy to monitor and manage your wireless network.

[Use Case 1: Secure Access Control]

One key feature that government customers value is secure access control. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up different SSIDs for different user groups. This is crucial for government agencies that need to separate sensitive data from public access. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs' to create a new SSID and assign it to a specific user group**.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]

Another use case that resonates with government customers is location analytics. Meraki MR access points have built-in location analytics capabilities that can provide valuable insights into foot traffic, dwell time, and repeat visitors. This data can be especially useful for government agencies looking to optimize their physical spaces. **Click 'Wireless > Location analytics' to view real-time data**.

[Use Case 3: Automatic RF Optimization]

Lastly, let's talk about automatic RF optimization. Meraki MR access points are equipped with intelligent algorithms that continuously monitor and adjust RF settings to ensure optimal performance. This is crucial for government agencies that need a reliable and high-performing wireless network. **Click 'Wireless > RF optimization' to see how Meraki MR handles interference**.

[Discussion Prompts]

Now, let's end with a few smart questions you can ask your government customers to prompt discussion:

1. How important is secure access control in your agency's wireless network?
2. Have you considered leveraging location analytics to optimize your physical spaces?
3. How do you currently handle RF optimization in your wireless network, and are you open to exploring automated solutions like Meraki MR?

Thank you for attending today's demo. We hope you feel more confident in pitching Meraki MR to our government customers. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
