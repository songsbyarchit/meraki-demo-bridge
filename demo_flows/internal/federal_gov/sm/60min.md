[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki SM demo focused on the Federal Gov sector. Our goal today is to enable our partners with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively pitch Meraki SM to potential customers in this sector. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Device Inventory Management]

One key use case for Federal Gov agencies is device inventory management. With Meraki SM, partners can offer a centralized platform for tracking all devices, from laptops to mobile phones. This not only helps agencies keep track of their assets but also ensures compliance with security protocols. To demonstrate this, let's **click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see the comprehensive device inventory.

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]

Another critical use case for Federal Gov agencies is security compliance. Meraki SM offers features like network access control and application whitelisting to ensure that only authorized devices and applications can access the network. Let's **click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to show how partners can set up customized security policies for their customers.

[Use Case 3: Remote Device Management]

In the Federal Gov sector, remote device management is essential, especially for agencies with employees working in the field or telecommuting. Meraki SM allows partners to remotely configure, monitor, and troubleshoot devices, saving time and resources. Let's **click 'Systems Manager > Remote Desktop'** to demonstrate how partners can remotely access and troubleshoot devices.

[Use Case 4: Geofencing for Location-Based Policies]

For Federal Gov agencies with sensitive locations or restricted areas, geofencing is a valuable feature. Partners can set up location-based policies using Meraki SM's geofencing capabilities to ensure that devices adhere to specific rules based on their physical location. Let's **click 'Systems Manager > Geofencing'** to show how partners can create geofences and set up policies.
