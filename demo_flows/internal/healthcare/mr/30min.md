Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo. Whether you're a partner reseller, a customer IT admin, or an internal SE, we're excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MR solution can revolutionize networking in the Healthcare sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Healthcare sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Healthcare sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into the demo. The Meraki Dashboard is your central platform for managing everything, giving you a single pane of glass for visibility, troubleshooting, and unified management. **Click 'Dashboard > Network-wide > Overview'** to see it in action.

In the Healthcare sector, Meraki MR shines in scenarios like:
1. **Guest Wi-Fi for Patients**: Easily set up secure, isolated networks for patients and visitors while maintaining compliance.
2. **IoT Device Management**: Monitor and control a wide range of medical devices and equipment with ease.
3. **Location Analytics**: Understand patient flow and staff movements for improved efficiency.

To address objections in healthcare, partners can arm themselves with TCO comparisons to tackle concerns around cost vs legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. We provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to support their selling efforts. And post-sale, we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations for support.
