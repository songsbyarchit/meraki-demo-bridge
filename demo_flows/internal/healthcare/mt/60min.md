[Opening]
Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MT demo focused on the Healthcare sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki MT to your healthcare customers. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Network Segmentation]
Let's start with a common use case in healthcare - network segmentation. In a healthcare setting, it's crucial to separate guest WiFi from secure patient data. With Meraki MT, you can easily create VLANs and apply access policies to ensure data security. **Click 'Configure > VLANs'** to see how simple it is to set up.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]
Another powerful tool for healthcare providers is location analytics. By using Meraki MT's integrated BLE technology, you can track the movement of assets, patients, and even staff members within the facility. This data can be used to optimize workflow, improve patient experience, and enhance security. **Click 'Monitor > Location Analytics'** to explore this feature.

[Use Case 3: Video Surveillance]
Security is a top priority in healthcare. With Meraki MT, you can easily set up and manage video surveillance cameras across your facility. From monitoring entrances to patient rooms, video surveillance helps ensure the safety of patients and staff. **Click 'Cameras > Live'** to see the live feed from a camera.

[Use Case 4: Remote Patient Monitoring]
In today's digital age, remote patient monitoring is becoming increasingly important. With Meraki MT's cloud-managed platform, healthcare providers can securely connect and monitor medical devices remotely. This enables better patient care, reduces hospital readmissions, and improves overall efficiency. **Click 'Devices > Remote Patient Monitoring'** to see this feature in action.
