[Opening]

Hello everyone and welcome to today's Meraki MT demo focused on the Healthcare sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki solutions to healthcare customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Network Security]

Imagine you're speaking to a healthcare provider who is concerned about protecting patient data and ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations. With Meraki MT, you can offer them a comprehensive network security solution. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security policies'** to show how easily policies can be configured to restrict access to sensitive information. This feature allows healthcare organizations to control who can access patient data and ensure that it remains secure at all times.

[Use Case 2: Remote Monitoring]

Now, let's consider a scenario where a healthcare facility needs to remotely monitor their network infrastructure. With Meraki MT, partners can offer a solution that allows IT teams to **click 'Monitor > Live tools > Ping'** to check the connectivity of critical devices. This capability enables healthcare providers to proactively identify and address network issues before they impact patient care.

[Use Case 3: Guest Wi-Fi Management]

Lastly, let's discuss the importance of providing secure guest Wi-Fi access in healthcare settings. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to demonstrate how partners can easily set up a separate guest network with limited access to sensitive data. This feature ensures that patients and visitors can stay connected without compromising the security of the healthcare facility's network.

[Smart Questions for Discussion]

1. How do you currently address network security concerns in your healthcare organization?
2. What challenges do you face in monitoring and managing your network infrastructure remotely?
3. How important is it for your healthcare facility to provide secure guest Wi-Fi access to patients and visitors?
