[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MG demo specifically tailored for the Healthcare sector. Today, we will focus on partner enablement and supporting you in effectively pitching the Meraki MG solution to customers in the healthcare industry.

Let's dive right in with a quick overview of the Meraki MG and its key features that are particularly beneficial for healthcare organizations.

[Overview of Meraki MG]

The Meraki MG is a cloud-managed voice gateway that provides secure, reliable connectivity for voice communication. It offers features such as automatic failover, Quality of Service (QoS) prioritization, and SIP ALG for seamless voice communication.

[Use Case 1: Telemedicine]

One key use case for the Meraki MG in the healthcare sector is telemedicine. With the rise of virtual healthcare services, healthcare organizations need a reliable voice gateway to ensure clear, uninterrupted communication between patients and healthcare providers. The Meraki MG's automatic failover feature ensures that communication is always available, even in the event of a network outage.

To set up QoS prioritization for telemedicine calls, **click 'Configure > Voice and video'** and adjust the QoS settings to prioritize voice traffic.

[Use Case 2: Remote Clinics]

Another use case for the Meraki MG is in remote clinics or satellite locations. Healthcare organizations with multiple locations can benefit from the Meraki MG's centralized management and monitoring capabilities. Partners can pitch the Meraki MG as a cost-effective solution for connecting remote clinics to the main network securely and reliably.

To set up remote clinic connectivity, **click 'Configure > VPN'** and configure site-to-site VPNs to connect the remote clinic to the main network.

[Use Case 3: Secure Guest Wi-Fi]

Lastly, the Meraki MG can also be used to provide secure guest Wi-Fi access in healthcare facilities. Partners can pitch the Meraki MG as a way to offer patients and visitors secure, reliable Wi-Fi access while ensuring that sensitive healthcare data remains protected.

To set up secure guest Wi-Fi, **click 'Configure > Wireless settings'** and enable the guest network with appropriate security settings.

[Prompt Questions]

To wrap up, here are two smart questions you can ask healthcare organizations to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing voice communication in your telemedicine services, and are you facing any challenges with reliability or security?
2. How do you ensure secure connectivity between your main facility and remote clinics, and what solutions are you currently using for this purpose?

Thank you for attending today's Meraki MG demo. We hope this session has equipped you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch the Meraki MG to healthcare organizations. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
