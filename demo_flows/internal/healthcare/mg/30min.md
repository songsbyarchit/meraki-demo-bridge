Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to walk you through our demo of Cisco Meraki's MG for the Healthcare sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Healthcare sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into the demo. In Healthcare, network reliability and security are critical. With Meraki MG, you have a powerful solution that offers seamless connectivity and robust security features.

One key use case is ensuring patient data privacy. With Meraki's centralized dashboard, **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Addressing > Group Policies'**, you can easily configure policies to restrict access to sensitive information.

Another use case is optimizing network performance for medical devices. By **clicking 'Wireless > Air Marshal'** on the dashboard, you can proactively monitor and mitigate any interference that might affect the performance of these devices.

Lastly, let's talk about guest access management. With Meraki, you can set up secure guest networks with just a few **clicks on 'Wireless > Configure > Guest Access'**. This feature is essential in healthcare settings where visitors need internet access without compromising network security.

Now, let's address some FAQs to support partners selling MG in the Healthcare space:
- Q: What objections might the partner hear in healthcare?
  A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

- Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
  A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

- Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
  A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thank you for joining me today. I hope this demo has equipped you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki MG to healthcare customers. Let's empower healthcare organizations with reliable and secure networking solutions.
