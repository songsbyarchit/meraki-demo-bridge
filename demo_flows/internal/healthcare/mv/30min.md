Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, a customer IT admin, or an internal SE, I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki MV can transform the way healthcare organizations manage their security and surveillance needs.

To kick things off, let me ask you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the healthcare sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're a healthcare provider looking to enhance the safety and security of your facilities. With Meraki MV, you can easily monitor entrances, patient rooms, and parking lots all from one centralized platform.

**Click 'Cameras' > 'Overview'** to see all your cameras in one place. The Meraki Dashboard gives you a single pane of glass view, providing visibility into your entire surveillance network.

Now, let's explore a specific use case. Say you want to investigate an incident in the emergency room. **Click on a specific camera feed** to zoom in and playback footage in real-time. The intuitive interface makes troubleshooting a breeze.

Another key feature of Meraki MV is its ability to unify management across multiple locations. Whether you have one clinic or a network of hospitals, **navigate to 'Network-wide' > 'Cameras'** to see all your devices and settings in one location.

As we wrap up, here are some FAQs to help you effectively pitch Meraki MV in the healthcare sector:

Q: What objections might the partner hear in healthcare?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thanks for joining me today. I hope this demo has given you a glimpse of how Meraki MV can revolutionize security and surveillance in the healthcare industry. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out.
