[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining this Meraki SM demo focused on the Healthcare sector. Today, we will be discussing how Meraki SM can support healthcare organizations in managing their devices effectively and securely. 

Let's start by talking about partner enablement. As partners, it's crucial to understand the unique needs of healthcare organizations and how Meraki SM can address those needs. By effectively pitching the benefits of Meraki SM to healthcare customers, you can help them streamline their device management and improve security.

[Use Case 1: Device Management]

Imagine a hospital with hundreds of medical devices spread across multiple locations. With Meraki SM, partners can easily enroll these devices, apply policies, and monitor their health status from a centralized dashboard. This simplifies the management process and ensures that all devices are up-to-date and secure.

To demonstrate this, let's **click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** in the Meraki dashboard. From here, partners can see a list of all enrolled devices, their status, and any policies that have been applied.

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]

Healthcare organizations are under strict regulations when it comes to data security. With Meraki SM, partners can ensure that all devices comply with security policies and receive real-time alerts if any device falls out of compliance. This helps healthcare organizations maintain a secure environment and avoid potential breaches.

Let's **click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to see how partners can set up custom security policies for healthcare devices. Partners can define rules for encryption, password requirements, and more to ensure compliance with industry regulations.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]

In a healthcare setting, downtime can have serious consequences. With Meraki SM, partners can remotely troubleshoot devices, push updates, and resolve issues without the need for onsite visits. This saves time and resources for healthcare organizations while ensuring that devices stay operational.

Let's **click 'Systems Manager > Remote Tools'** to see how partners can remotely access and troubleshoot devices. This feature allows partners to quickly diagnose and resolve issues, keeping healthcare operations running smoothly.
