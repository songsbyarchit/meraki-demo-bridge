Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's SM solution can revolutionize networking in the healthcare sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the healthcare sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the healthcare sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into some specific use cases for healthcare:

1. **IoT Device Management**: Monitor and control medical devices seamlessly.
2. **Guest WiFi Access**: Provide secure, reliable WiFi for patients and visitors.
3. **HIPAA Compliance**: Ensure data security and compliance with healthcare regulations.
4. **Location Analytics**: Track asset and patient movement for improved efficiency.
5. **Remote Site Connectivity**: Connect branch offices and clinics effortlessly.
6. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate sensitive data for enhanced security.

Throughout these use cases, you'll see how the Meraki Dashboard serves as a central platform for visibility, troubleshooting, and management. Let's **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time device connections and **click 'Configure > Firewall rules'** to set up HIPAA compliance measures.

As you pitch SM to healthcare customers, anticipate objections like cost vs legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. Arm yourself with TCO comparisons to address these concerns effectively.

We provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to support your sales efforts. Post-sale, we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations for any support needs.

Thanks for joining me on this journey through Cisco Meraki's SM solution for healthcare. Let's empower healthcare organizations with seamless, secure, and scalable networking solutions.
