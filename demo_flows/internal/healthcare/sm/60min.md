Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki SM demo focused on the Healthcare sector. Our goal is to equip our partners with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively pitch Meraki SM to healthcare customers. Let's dive in.

[Use Case 1: Device Management]
Let's start with device management. With Meraki SM, you can easily deploy and manage devices across multiple healthcare facilities from one centralized dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Add devices'** to see how simple it is to enroll new devices and push out updates remotely.

[Use Case 2: Security Compliance]
In the healthcare sector, security compliance is crucial. Meraki SM helps ensure that all devices meet industry standards by enforcing security policies and monitoring for any potential threats. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security policies'** to set up compliance rules and monitor device security.

[Use Case 3: Location Tracking]
For healthcare facilities with a large number of mobile devices, location tracking is essential for asset management and patient care. With Meraki SM, you can track the real-time location of devices and even set up geofences for restricted areas. **Click 'Systems Manager > Location tracking'** to see how easy it is to monitor device movements.

[Use Case 4: App Management]
Managing healthcare-specific applications on devices can be a challenge. Meraki SM simplifies this process by allowing you to push out updates, control access to apps, and even remotely wipe data if a device is lost or stolen. **Click 'Systems Manager > App management'** to explore these features.

[Use Case 5: Remote Troubleshooting]
In a healthcare setting, downtime is not an option. With Meraki SM, IT teams can remotely troubleshoot device issues, push out fixes, and ensure that healthcare professionals have uninterrupted access to critical systems. **Click 'Systems Manager > Remote troubleshooting'** to see how this feature works in action.

[Use Case 6: Guest Access Management]
Healthcare facilities often have visitors who need temporary access to Wi-Fi networks. Meraki SM allows you to set up secure guest access policies, monitor guest activity, and ensure that your network remains secure at all times. **Click 'Systems Manager > Guest access'** to learn more about this feature.
