[Opening]

Welcome everyone to today's Meraki MS demo! Today, we'll be focusing on how our Meraki MS switches can benefit healthcare organizations. This demo is tailored to help our partners effectively pitch Meraki MS to healthcare customers. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Network Security]

Let's start with network security, a crucial aspect for healthcare organizations. With Meraki MS, partners can offer healthcare customers a simple and effective way to secure their network. Through the intuitive dashboard, partners can easily **set up access control policies** to ensure only authorized devices have access to sensitive patient data.

[Use Case 2: Remote Monitoring]

Another use case is remote monitoring. Healthcare organizations often have multiple locations that need to be monitored. With Meraki MS, partners can **remotely monitor and troubleshoot network issues** across all locations from a single dashboard. This not only saves time but also ensures minimal downtime for critical systems.

[Use Case 3: Quality of Service]

Quality of service is essential in healthcare, where real-time communication is crucial. Partners can leverage Meraki MS to **prioritize traffic** such as VoIP calls or telemedicine sessions to ensure a seamless experience for healthcare professionals and patients.

[Use Case 4: Device Management]

In the healthcare sector, there are numerous IoT devices and medical equipment connected to the network. With Meraki MS, partners can easily **manage and monitor these devices** to ensure they are functioning properly and securely.

[Smart Questions]

Now, let's wrap up with a few smart questions our partners can ask healthcare customers:

1. How are you currently managing network security across your healthcare facilities?
2. What challenges do you face in monitoring and managing network infrastructure across multiple locations?
3. How important is real-time communication and quality of service for your healthcare organization?
