Hello and welcome, partners! Today's demo will focus on how Cisco Meraki's MS products can benefit healthcare organizations. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's kick things off with a look at the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Dashboard'** to access the centralized platform that provides visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management for healthcare networks.

One key use case in healthcare is ensuring secure and reliable connectivity for critical medical devices. **Navigate to 'Switch > Access Control'** to set up policies that prioritize traffic for life-saving equipment.

Another important feature is the ability to monitor network performance in real-time. **Click 'Monitor > Performance'** to view detailed analytics and ensure optimal network performance for patient care applications.

For healthcare organizations with multiple locations, **click 'Configure > Templates'** to easily deploy network configurations across different sites, saving time and ensuring consistency.

Lastly, let's address the need for robust security measures in healthcare. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Content Filtering'** to set up policies that protect patient data and comply with industry regulations.

As partners selling MS in healthcare, you may encounter objections related to cost compared to legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. Arm yourself with TCO comparisons to address these concerns effectively.

Additionally, we provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to support your sales efforts in the healthcare space.

Post-sale, we offer onboarding support through co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations handled by Meraki support. We are committed to helping you succeed in selling MS to healthcare organizations.
