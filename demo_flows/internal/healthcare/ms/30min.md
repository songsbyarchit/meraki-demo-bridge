[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MS demo focused on the Healthcare sector. Today, we will be discussing how our Meraki MS product can help healthcare organizations improve their network infrastructure and operations.

[Use Case 1: Network Segmentation]

Let's start with a common use case in the healthcare sector - network segmentation. In healthcare facilities, it's crucial to keep sensitive patient data secure and separate from other network traffic. With Meraki MS, partners can easily create VLANs and segment their network traffic to ensure patient data remains confidential. **click 'Configure > VLANs'**

[Use Case 2: Quality of Service (QoS)]

Another important use case in healthcare is ensuring high-quality communication and data transfer. With Meraki MS, partners can prioritize network traffic using Quality of Service (QoS) settings to ensure that critical applications, such as telemedicine and electronic health records, receive the necessary bandwidth. **click 'Configure > QoS'**

[Use Case 3: Remote Monitoring and Troubleshooting]

Lastly, let's talk about remote monitoring and troubleshooting. Healthcare organizations often have multiple locations and limited IT staff on-site. With Meraki MS, partners can remotely monitor and troubleshoot network issues, saving time and resources. **click 'Monitor > Network-wide > Performance'**

[Smart Questions]

Now, let's end with a few smart questions that partners can ask healthcare organizations:

1. How are you currently managing network security and compliance in your healthcare facility?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face in ensuring high-quality communication and data transfer across your network?
3. How do you currently handle remote monitoring and troubleshooting of network issues in your healthcare organization?
