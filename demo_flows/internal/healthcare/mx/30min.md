Hey there, thanks for joining me today! Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to dive into how Cisco Meraki MX can revolutionize networking in the Healthcare sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Healthcare sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Alright, let's jump into the demo now. I want to showcase how the Meraki Dashboard acts as a single pane of glass for all your network needs. **Click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN'** to see how easy it is to manage policies and settings across all your MX devices.

Now, let's explore a specific use case in Healthcare. Imagine needing to securely connect multiple clinics and hospitals under one network. With Meraki MX, you can easily **click 'Configure > Site-to-site VPN'** to set up encrypted tunnels for seamless communication.

Another crucial feature for the Healthcare sector is content filtering. Let's **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'** to see how you can ensure compliance and protect sensitive data with just a few clicks.

As we wrap up, here are a couple of FAQs to equip our partners in selling MX to Healthcare clients:

  A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.
