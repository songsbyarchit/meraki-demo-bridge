Hey there! Today, we're going to dive into the world of Cisco Meraki, specifically focusing on the MX product tailored for the Healthcare sector. Whether you're a partner reseller, a customer IT admin, or an internal SE, this demo is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki solutions in the Healthcare space.

Let's start by getting a sense of the current landscape. For our partners out there, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Healthcare sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, for our customers, what does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?

And for our internal team, what common questions do our customers ask in the Healthcare sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Moving on, let's explore some specific use cases tailored for Healthcare:

1. **Ensuring HIPAA Compliance**: Utilize MX's advanced security features to maintain strict compliance with healthcare regulations.
2. **Telemedicine Support**: Enable secure and reliable connectivity for telemedicine services to reach patients remotely.
3. **Patient Data Protection**: Safeguard sensitive patient data with robust firewall and VPN capabilities.
4. **Guest Wi-Fi Segmentation**: Easily create separate networks for patients, staff, and guests to ensure network security and compliance.

Now, let's take a closer look at the Meraki Dashboard, your central platform for visibility and management:

**Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat Protection' to monitor and manage security policies.**
**Navigate to 'Wireless > Access Points' to check network performance and client connectivity.**
**Click 'Monitor > Clients' to view detailed information on connected devices.**
**Explore 'Switch > Switch Ports' to troubleshoot and configure network switches.**

In the Healthcare sector, partners may encounter objections such as cost vs legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. Arm them with TCO comparisons to address these concerns effectively.

Additionally, we provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to support their sales efforts.

For onboarding post-sale, we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations handling through Meraki support.
