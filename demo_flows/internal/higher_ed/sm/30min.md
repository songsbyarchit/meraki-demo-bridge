Hey there, thanks for joining us today! Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, we're excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's SM solution can revolutionize networking in the Higher Education sector. 

To kick things off, let's dive in with a couple of warm-up questions:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Higher Education sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's explore how Meraki SM can address the specific needs of the Higher Education sector. Imagine having complete visibility and control over your network through the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Network-wide' > 'Clients'** to see real-time insights into device usage and behavior. This level of visibility enables simplified troubleshooting and unified management across all your network devices. 

One key use case in Higher Education is ensuring secure connectivity for both students and faculty. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN' > 'Firewall'** to easily configure policies that protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Another use case is optimizing network performance in lecture halls and common areas. **Click 'Wireless' > 'Access points'** to set up seamless roaming and prioritize bandwidth for critical applications.

As partners, you may encounter objections in the Higher Education space. Remember to address concerns around cost compared to legacy vendors and skepticism towards cloud-managed security. Arm yourself with TCO comparisons to showcase the long-term value Meraki SM brings. Additionally, we provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to enhance your pitch. 

When it comes to onboarding post-sale, we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations through Meraki support. This ensures a smooth transition for customers as they integrate Meraki SM into their network infrastructure. 

Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to supporting you in effectively pitching Meraki SM to Higher Education institutions.
