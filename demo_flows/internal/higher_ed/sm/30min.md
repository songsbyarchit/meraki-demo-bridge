[Opening slide with agenda]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki SM demo focused on the Higher Ed sector. Today, we'll be diving into the features and use cases that are most relevant to our education partners. 

Let's start by talking about the challenges faced by universities and colleges when it comes to managing their IT infrastructure. With a large number of devices spread across campus, it can be a daunting task to keep everything secure and up to date. That's where Meraki SM comes in to make life easier for both IT admins and end-users.

**Use case 1: Device onboarding for students**
Imagine a new student arrives on campus with their own device. With Meraki SM, IT admins can easily onboard the device by sending a simple enrollment link. The student can then self-enroll their device, ensuring it meets all the necessary security requirements set by the institution.

**Use case 2: Remote troubleshooting**
Now, let's say a professor is having trouble connecting to the campus Wi-Fi. With Meraki SM, IT admins can remotely troubleshoot the issue by accessing the device's network settings and making necessary configurations without having to be physically present on campus.

**Use case 3: Application deployment for classrooms**
In a classroom setting, professors often require specific applications to be installed on student devices for a particular lesson. With Meraki SM, IT admins can easily deploy these applications to all devices in a specific classroom, ensuring that students have access to the necessary tools for their learning experience.

Now, let's dive into the demo. **Click 'Dashboard' to see an overview of all managed devices on campus.** From here, you can easily see the status of each device and perform actions like pushing out software updates or setting security policies.

As you can see, Meraki SM provides a centralized platform for managing all devices on campus, making it a valuable tool for Higher Ed institutions. 

[Ending slide with discussion prompts]

1. How are you currently managing devices on campus, and what pain points do you face in this process?
2. What specific challenges are you facing when it comes to ensuring the security and compliance of devices across your institution?
3. How do you see Meraki SM fitting into your overall IT strategy for Higher Ed?
