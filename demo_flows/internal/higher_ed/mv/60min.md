[Welcome & Introduction]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MV demo session. Today, we will be focusing on how Meraki MV can benefit the Higher Ed sector and how you, as our partners, can effectively pitch this solution to your customers.

[Use Case 1: Campus Security]

Let's start with one of the most crucial use cases for Higher Ed institutions - campus security. With Meraki MV, your customers can easily monitor all areas of their campus in real-time, with high-quality video footage. They can set up motion-based alerts to quickly respond to any suspicious activity. **Click 'Cameras > Alerts'** to show how easy it is to configure alerts.

[Use Case 2: Student Safety]

Another important use case is student safety. Meraki MV allows your customers to create virtual perimeters around sensitive areas on campus, such as dormitories or research labs. They can receive alerts whenever someone enters these restricted areas. **Click 'Cameras > Motion Search'** to demonstrate how motion search can easily locate any specific event in the video footage.

[Use Case 3: Parking Lot Monitoring]

Parking lot monitoring is also a common concern for Higher Ed institutions. With Meraki MV, your customers can keep an eye on their parking lots to ensure the safety of their students and staff. They can set up license plate recognition to track vehicles entering and exiting the campus. **Click 'Cameras > License Plate Recognition'** to showcase this feature.

[Use Case 4: Lecture Capture]

For educational purposes, Meraki MV can also be used for lecture capture. Your customers can record classroom lectures and make them available for students to review later. They can easily schedule recordings and access them from any device. **Click 'Cameras > Recording'** to demonstrate how to set up scheduled recordings.

[Prompting Discussion]

Now that we have covered some key use cases, here are a few questions to prompt discussion:
1. How do you see Meraki MV fitting into your customer's existing security infrastructure?
2. What are some specific challenges your Higher Ed customers are facing when it comes to campus security?
3. How can we support you in effectively pitching Meraki MV to your customers in the Higher Ed sector?

We hope you now have a better understanding of how Meraki MV can benefit Higher Ed institutions and how you can effectively pitch this solution to your customers.
