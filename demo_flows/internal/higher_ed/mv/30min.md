Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. Whether you're a partner reseller, a customer IT admin, or an internal SE, we're excited to show you the power of Cisco Meraki's MV solution tailored for the Higher Education sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions:

Now, let's dive into the demo.

**Use Case 1: Campus Security**
Imagine having real-time visibility into your campus security cameras, all from a single pane of glass on the Meraki Dashboard. With just a **click 'Cameras > Live View'**, you can monitor entrances, parking lots, and common areas to ensure a safe environment for students and staff.

**Use Case 2: Lecture Capture**
Recording lectures and sharing them securely with students has never been easier. With MV's cloud-managed solution, you can **click 'Cameras > Video Settings'** to schedule recordings, manage storage, and access footage from any device.

**Use Case 3: Student Safety**
In case of emergencies, quick response is crucial. With MV smart cameras, you can **click 'Cameras > Motion Alerts'** to receive instant notifications and take action, ensuring the safety of everyone on campus.

Now, let's address some common FAQs to support partners selling MV in the Higher Education space:
