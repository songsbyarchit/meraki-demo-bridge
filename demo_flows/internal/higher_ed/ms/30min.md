Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to show you how our Cisco Meraki MS solution can revolutionize networking in the Higher Education sector.

To kick things off, let's chat a bit about the challenges you're facing in this space. Partners, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in Higher Education? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions here?

Now, let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're an IT admin at a university. Your network is sprawling, with buildings scattered across campus. With **click 'Network-wide > Overview'**, the Meraki Dashboard gives you a bird's eye view of the entire network, allowing you to easily monitor and manage all your switches from a single pane of glass.

One common headache in Higher Ed is troubleshooting network issues in dorms. Let's say you receive complaints about slow Wi-Fi in a residence hall. By **click 'Switch > Monitor > Clients'**, you can quickly identify the problematic devices and take action to resolve the issue, ensuring a seamless experience for students.

For larger campuses, network segmentation is crucial. With **click 'Configure > Switch ports'**, you can easily create VLANs to separate traffic and enhance security. This feature is especially valuable in environments where student, faculty, and guest networks need to be isolated.

Now, let's address some FAQs to support our partners in selling MS to Higher Education institutions:

Q: What objections might the partner hear in Higher Ed?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

That's a wrap! Thanks for joining me on this demo. Let's empower our partners to excel in the Higher Education sector with Cisco Meraki MS.
