Hello and welcome! Today, we're going to dive into a demo of Cisco Meraki's MS product, specifically tailored for the Higher Education sector. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, the goal of this demo is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch and leverage the MS solution in the education space.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Higher Education sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like in your educational institution? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Higher Education sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's explore the power of Cisco Meraki's MS product in the Higher Education sector:

1. **Click 'Switches' tab on the Meraki Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to 'Topology' view to visualize network layout**
3. **Click on a specific switch to view port details and connected devices**
4. **Enable 'Virtual Stacking' to simplify switch management across multiple locations**
5. **Set up VLANs for different departments or areas within the institution**
6. **Utilize 'Switch Port Scheduling' to automate port access control based on class schedules**

In the Higher Education sector, partners may encounter objections such as cost vs legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. Arm them with TCO comparisons to address these concerns effectively. Furthermore, we provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to support their sales efforts. Post-sale, we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations handling through Meraki support to ensure smooth onboarding for customers.
