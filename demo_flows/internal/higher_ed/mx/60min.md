[Opening]

Good morning everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MX demo focused on the Higher Ed sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch the Meraki MX to our customers in the education space.

Let's start by diving into some key use cases that are particularly relevant to Higher Ed institutions.

[Use Case 1: Secure Campus Network]

One of the top priorities for Higher Ed institutions is ensuring a secure network for students, faculty, and staff. With the Meraki MX, we can easily set up secure VPN tunnels for remote access, implement content filtering to block malicious sites, and use intrusion detection and prevention to protect against cyber threats. Let's **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat Protection'** to see how easy it is to configure these security measures.

[Use Case 2: Bandwidth Management]

In a busy campus environment, bandwidth management is crucial to ensure a smooth online experience for everyone. With the Meraki MX, we can prioritize critical applications like online learning platforms and video conferencing, while limiting bandwidth for non-essential activities. Let's **click 'Traffic Shaping'** to see how we can easily set up application-based policies.

[Use Case 3: Guest Wi-Fi Access]

Many Higher Ed institutions host events and conferences where guest Wi-Fi access is needed. With the Meraki MX, we can quickly set up a separate guest network with customizable splash pages and time-limited access. Let's **click 'Wireless > Splash page'** to see how simple it is to create a branded guest Wi-Fi experience.

[Use Case 4: Remote Learning Support]

In today's hybrid learning environment, it's essential to support remote students and faculty. The Meraki MX allows for seamless integration with cloud-based applications like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, ensuring a reliable connection for virtual classes and meetings. Let's **click 'SD-WAN & Traffic Shaping'** to see how we can prioritize these collaboration tools for optimal performance.

[Discussion Prompts]

Now that we've covered some key use cases, here are a few questions to prompt discussion with our customers:

1. How is your current network infrastructure supporting remote learning initiatives?
2. What are your biggest security concerns when it comes to campus networks?
3. How do you currently manage bandwidth allocation for different user groups on your campus?

Thank you for attending today's Meraki MX demo. We hope you feel more confident in pitching this solution to our Higher Ed customers. If you have any further questions or would like to schedule a deeper dive, please reach out to our team.
