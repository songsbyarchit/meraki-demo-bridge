Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo on Cisco Meraki's MX for the Higher Education sector. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, we're excited to show you how Meraki can transform networking in this space.

Before we dive in, could our partners share what trends or challenges they're seeing with customers in higher education? What makes positioning solutions in this sector unique or tricky for you?

Now, let's explore how Meraki MX can address these needs. With the Meraki Dashboard as your central platform, you have a single pane of glass for visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management. Let's **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security Appliance'** to see how easy it is to configure security policies tailored for higher education institutions.

One key use case for Higher Education is **click 'SD-WAN & traffic shaping > Traffic shaping'** to ensure critical applications like video conferencing or e-learning platforms always have enough bandwidth, even during peak times.

Another use case is **click 'VPN > Site-to-site VPN'** for secure connectivity between campuses or remote learning centers, ensuring seamless collaboration and data protection.

In this sector, partners may face objections around cost vs legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. Arm yourself with TCO comparisons to address these concerns effectively.

For partner enablement, we provide access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars. Post-sale, we offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations handling by Meraki support. 

We hope this demo has shown you the power of Meraki MX in Higher Education. Let's work together to empower institutions with reliable, secure, and scalable networking solutions. Thank you for joining us today!
