Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to showcase how Cisco Meraki's MT can revolutionize networking in the Higher Education sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Higher Education sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into some key use cases for Higher Education:
1. **Enhanced Campus Security:** **click 'Security > Cameras'** to see real-time monitoring and alerts for campus security.
2. **BYOD Management:** **click 'Wireless > Splash page'** to set up a seamless onboarding experience for students and staff.
3. **Bandwidth Control:** **click 'Traffic shaping > WAN 1'** to prioritize critical applications during peak usage times.

The Meraki Dashboard serves as a single pane of glass for all your network needs, providing visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management. **click 'Dashboard > Overview'** to see a snapshot of your network health.

Now, let's address some FAQs to support partners selling MT in Higher Education:
- Q: What objections might the partner hear in higher education?
  A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.
  
- Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
  A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.
  
- Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
  A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thanks for joining me in this demo. I hope you're as excited as I am about the possibilities that MT can bring to the Higher Education sector. Let's work together to empower our partners and customers for success.
