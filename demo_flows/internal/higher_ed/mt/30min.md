[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MT demo. Today, we will be focusing on how Meraki MT can benefit the Higher Ed sector and how our partners can effectively pitch this solution to customers.

Let's start by discussing some key use cases for Meraki MT in Higher Ed:

[Use Case 1: Campus Network Management]
One of the main challenges faced by Higher Ed institutions is managing a large and diverse campus network. With Meraki MT, partners can offer a centralized dashboard that allows IT administrators to easily monitor and manage all network devices from a single interface. This includes switches, access points, and security appliances. To demonstrate this, let's **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to show how easy it is to configure and monitor switch ports in real-time.

[Use Case 2: Student Housing Wi-Fi]
Another common use case in Higher Ed is providing reliable Wi-Fi coverage in student housing. With Meraki MT, partners can offer seamless roaming capabilities and bandwidth control to ensure a consistent and secure Wi-Fi experience for students. Let's **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to show how partners can easily set up different SSIDs for student and guest networks with customized access policies.

[Use Case 3: Network Security]
Lastly, network security is a top priority for Higher Ed institutions. With Meraki MT, partners can offer advanced security features such as intrusion detection and prevention, content filtering, and VPN capabilities. Let's **click 'Security > Content filtering'** to show how partners can set up content filtering policies to protect students and faculty from malicious websites.

[Smart Questions for Discussion]
Now, let's end with some smart questions that partners can ask their customers to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing your campus network and what challenges are you facing?
2. What are your top priorities when it comes to student housing Wi-Fi and network security?
3. How important is scalability and ease of management in your IT infrastructure planning?
