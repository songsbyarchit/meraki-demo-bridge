Great, thank you all for joining today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, we're excited to have you here for this demo focused on our **MG** product tailored for the Higher Education sector.

To kick things off, I'd love to hear from our partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in higher education? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

(Allow for responses)

Now, let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're working with a university looking to upgrade their network infrastructure. Let's see how **MG** can address some common pain points in the Higher Education sector.

First off, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for network management. **Click 'Dashboard'** to get started.

Here, you'll see a single pane of glass view that provides visibility into the entire network. From here, you can easily troubleshoot issues, manage devices, and ensure seamless connectivity across campus.

One of the key benefits of **MG** is its ability to simplify network management. Let's **navigate to 'Wireless > Access Points'** to see how easy it is to configure and monitor wireless devices.

Next, let's explore some specific use cases for **MG** in Higher Education:
1. **Enhanced Security**: Utilize advanced security features such as intrusion detection and content filtering to protect sensitive student data.
2. **Guest Access Management**: Easily set up secure guest networks for campus visitors without compromising network integrity.
3. **Application Prioritization**: Ensure critical applications like online exams or video conferencing have priority access to bandwidth.
4. **Location Analytics**: Track student foot traffic and behavior patterns to optimize campus layout and resource allocation.

Moving on, let's **click 'Switch > Switch ports'** to see how **MG** simplifies network configuration and management for switches on campus.

Before we wrap up, let's address some common FAQs for partners selling **MG** in the Higher Education sector:

Q: What objections might the partner hear in higher education?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thank you all for your time today. We hope this demo has equipped you with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively pitch **MG** to Higher Education customers. Feel free to reach out with any further questions or for additional support.
