Let's start by looking at the key features and benefits of the Meraki MG and how it can help Higher Ed institutions improve their network connectivity.

[Key Features and Benefits]

- The Meraki MG is a cloud-managed gateway that provides reliable and secure connectivity for campus networks.
- It offers seamless integration with the rest of the Meraki ecosystem, making it easy to manage and troubleshoot network issues.
- The Meraki MG also provides advanced analytics and reporting capabilities, allowing administrators to monitor network performance and make data-driven decisions.

[Use Case 1: Improved WiFi Coverage]
One common challenge in Higher Ed institutions is providing consistent WiFi coverage across campus. With the Meraki MG, administrators can easily extend their network coverage by deploying additional gateways where needed. This ensures that students and faculty have reliable WiFi access wherever they go on campus.

To demonstrate this, let's **click 'Configure > Wireless > Access Points'** and show how easy it is to add a new gateway to the network.

[Use Case 2: Guest Network Management]
Another important use case for Higher Ed institutions is managing guest network access. With the Meraki MG, administrators can set up a separate guest network with customizable access policies. This allows visitors to connect to the network securely without compromising the institution's main network.

Let's **click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN > Guest Policies'** to show how easy it is to set up guest network policies.

[Use Case 3: Bandwidth Prioritization]
In a Higher Ed setting, it's important to prioritize bandwidth for critical applications such as online learning platforms and research tools. With the Meraki MG, administrators can easily prioritize bandwidth for specific applications or users, ensuring a seamless experience for all users on the network.

Let's **click 'Configure > SD-WAN & Traffic Shaping > Application Prioritization'** to demonstrate how to prioritize bandwidth for a specific application.

[Use Case 4: VPN Configuration]
Higher Ed institutions often have remote campuses or off-site research facilities that need secure connectivity. With the Meraki MG, administrators can easily set up secure VPN connections to ensure that remote locations have reliable and secure access to the main network.

Let's **click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN > VPN'** to show how easy it is to set up a VPN connection.
