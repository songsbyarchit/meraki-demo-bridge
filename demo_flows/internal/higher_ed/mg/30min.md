Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MG demo focusing on the Higher Ed sector. Today, we will be looking at how our solution can benefit educational institutions and how you, as partners, can effectively pitch this to your customers.

Let's start by discussing the challenges that Higher Ed institutions face when it comes to managing their network infrastructure. With the increasing number of devices on campus and the need for high-speed internet access, traditional networking solutions often fall short in providing the scalability and reliability that these institutions require.

This is where the Meraki MG comes in. Our cloud-managed gateway provides seamless connectivity for campuses, allowing for easy deployment and management of network resources. With features like auto VPN and traffic shaping, Higher Ed institutions can ensure a secure and optimized network experience for their students and staff.

Now, let's dive into a couple of use cases that highlight the benefits of the Meraki MG in the Higher Ed sector:

1. **Network Expansion**: Imagine a scenario where a university is expanding its campus and needs to quickly deploy new network resources. With the Meraki MG, partners can easily set up new gateways and configure them through the intuitive Meraki dashboard. This not only saves time but also ensures a seamless integration of the new network resources into the existing infrastructure.

2. **Bandwidth Management**: In a busy lecture hall where multiple students are streaming videos or downloading files, bandwidth can quickly become a bottleneck. With the Meraki MG's traffic shaping capabilities, partners can prioritize critical applications and ensure a consistent network performance for all users. This can significantly enhance the learning experience for students and improve overall satisfaction with the network.

Now, let's move on to a quick demo of the Meraki dashboard. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to show how partners can easily configure network settings and monitor performance in real-time.

Before we wrap up, here are a couple of smart questions that you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing network resources on your campus, and what challenges are you facing?
2. Have you considered cloud-managed solutions like the Meraki MG to simplify network deployment and management?
3. How important is network reliability and security in ensuring a seamless learning experience for your students and staff?

Thank you for joining today's demo, and we hope you found it informative. If you have any further questions or would like to learn more about how the Meraki MG can benefit your Higher Ed customers, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team.
