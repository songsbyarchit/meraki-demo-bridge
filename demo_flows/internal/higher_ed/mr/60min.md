[Opening]

Welcome everyone to today's Meraki MR demo focused on the Higher Ed sector. Our goal today is to equip our partners with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively pitch Meraki MR solutions to their Higher Ed customers. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Access]
One common use case in Higher Ed is providing secure and reliable guest Wi-Fi access for visitors to campus. With Meraki MR, partners can easily set up a separate guest network with customized login portals and time limits. **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a new SSID specifically for guest access.

[Use Case 2: Classroom Wi-Fi Coverage]
Another key use case for Higher Ed institutions is ensuring seamless Wi-Fi coverage in classrooms. Meraki MR's intelligent mesh technology automatically optimizes coverage and performance, making it easy to scale Wi-Fi networks across multiple classrooms. **click 'Monitor > Access points'** to view real-time coverage maps and client connectivity.

[Use Case 3: Student Housing Networks]
In student housing, network security and bandwidth management are crucial. With Meraki MR, partners can set up dynamic VLANs to segregate traffic and prioritize bandwidth for academic activities. **click 'Configure > Wireless > Access control'** to set up VLANs and traffic shaping rules for student networks.

[Use Case 4: Campus Events and Outdoor Coverage]
For outdoor events and campus-wide coverage, partners can leverage Meraki MR's outdoor access points and antennas. These devices are weatherproof and designed to provide reliable Wi-Fi coverage in any environment. **click 'Configure > Wireless > Access points'** to add outdoor access points to the network.

Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with a few smart questions to ask your Higher Ed customers:
1. How are you currently managing guest Wi-Fi access on campus, and are there any pain points you're experiencing?
2. What are your network security requirements for student housing, and how do you currently address them?
3. Have you considered expanding Wi-Fi coverage to outdoor areas for campus events or student gatherings?

Thank you for joining us today. We hope you found this demo valuable in preparing you to pitch Meraki MR solutions to your Higher Ed customers. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
