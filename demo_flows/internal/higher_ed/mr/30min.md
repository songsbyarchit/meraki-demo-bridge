With the Meraki MR, you can easily set up a wireless network that covers every corner of the campus. **click 'Configure > Wireless networks'** You can create different SSIDs for students, staff, and guests, each with their own access policies. Plus, the cloud-based dashboard allows for centralized management, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

[Use Case 2: Secure Access Control for Dormitories]

Another use case that Higher Ed institutions often face is ensuring secure access control in dormitories. With the Meraki MR, you can set up different access levels for students, faculty, and administrators. **click 'Configure > Access control'** You can also integrate it with your existing authentication systems for a seamless user experience. This not only enhances security but also provides a better user experience for everyone on campus.

[Use Case 3: Location Analytics for Student Engagement]

Lastly, let's talk about how the Meraki MR can help in improving student engagement through location analytics. By leveraging the built-in analytics tools, you can gather valuable insights on student behavior and preferences. **click 'Monitor > Location analytics'** This data can be used to optimize campus layouts, improve resource allocation, and even tailor marketing campaigns to better engage students.
