Presenter: Hi everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MS demo focused on the Professional Services sector. Today, we'll be diving into some key use cases and features that can help you effectively pitch to customers in this industry. Let's get started.

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility and Control]

Presenter: One of the key challenges in the Professional Services sector is ensuring network reliability and security. With Meraki MS, you can easily monitor and manage your network from anywhere. Let's take a look at how you can gain visibility and control over your network.

**Log into the Meraki dashboard and click 'Monitor > Switches' to see an overview of all connected devices. From here, you can see real-time data on network usage, traffic patterns, and device health.**

Presenter: This level of visibility allows you to proactively identify and address any network issues before they impact your business operations. It's a game-changer for Professional Services firms looking to ensure uptime and performance.

[Use Case 2: Seamless Network Expansion]

Presenter: Another common challenge in this sector is the need for seamless network expansion as companies grow and add new locations. With Meraki MS, you can easily scale your network without the need for complex configurations or additional hardware.

**Click 'Configure > Switch ports' to add new devices to your network. With just a few clicks, you can provision new switches and access points, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free expansion process.**

Presenter: This feature is particularly valuable for Professional Services firms that are constantly evolving and adding new offices or branches. It allows them to quickly adapt to changing business needs without any downtime.

[Use Case 3: Network Security]

Presenter: Lastly, network security is a top priority for Professional Services firms, especially when handling sensitive client data. Meraki MS offers robust security features to protect your network from cyber threats and unauthorized access.

**Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Access policies' to set up granular access controls and policies for different user groups. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data and applications.**

Presenter: By implementing these security measures, Professional Services firms can mitigate the risk of data breaches and ensure compliance with industry regulations.
