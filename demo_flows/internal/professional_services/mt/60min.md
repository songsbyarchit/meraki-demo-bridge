[Opening]

Hello everyone and welcome to today's Meraki MT demo focused on the Professional Services sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki solutions to our customers. Let's dive in!

[Use Case 1: Network Security]

Let's start with a common use case in the Professional Services sector - network security. With Meraki MT, we can easily set up firewall rules to control traffic flow and ensure data protection. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to demonstrate how simple it is to configure these rules.

[Use Case 2: Remote Access]

Another important aspect for Professional Services firms is enabling remote access for employees. With Meraki MT, we can set up VPN connections quickly and securely. **Click 'Configure > VPN'** to show how easy it is to create and manage these connections.

[Use Case 3: Network Monitoring]

Monitoring network performance is crucial for Professional Services firms to ensure optimal operation. With Meraki MT, we have real-time visibility into network traffic and can proactively address any issues. **Click 'Monitor > Live Tools'** to demonstrate the monitoring capabilities.

[Use Case 4: Guest Wi-Fi]

Professional Services firms often have clients visiting their offices. With Meraki MT, we can easily set up a separate guest Wi-Fi network to provide secure access while keeping the main network protected. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to show how to configure a guest network.
