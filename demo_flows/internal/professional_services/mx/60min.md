[Opening]

Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MX demo focused on the Professional Services sector. Today, we will be discussing how our Meraki MX can help partners effectively pitch to customers in this sector. Let's dive right in.

[Use Case 1: Secure Remote Access]

Presenter: One common use case in the Professional Services sector is the need for secure remote access for employees. With Meraki MX, partners can easily set up client VPNs for remote workers. **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Client VPN'**. This feature allows employees to securely access the network from anywhere, ensuring sensitive data remains protected.

[Use Case 2: Network Segmentation]

Presenter: Another important aspect for professional services firms is network segmentation. With Meraki MX, partners can easily create different VLANs for different departments or clients. This helps in ensuring that sensitive client data is kept separate from other network traffic. **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Addressing & VLANs'**.

[Use Case 3: Application Layer Visibility]

Presenter: Meraki MX also provides partners with deep visibility into the applications running on the network. This feature is essential for professional services firms to monitor and control the use of bandwidth-intensive applications. **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Application visibility'**.

[Use Case 4: Auto VPN]

Presenter: Partners can also leverage Meraki MX's Auto VPN feature to easily set up site-to-site VPN connections between multiple offices. This is crucial for professional services firms with multiple locations that need to securely communicate with each other. **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'**.

[Prompt questions]

Presenter: Now, before we wrap up, I'd like to ask you all a couple of questions:
1. How important is network security for your professional services firm?
2. Have you encountered any challenges with remote access for your employees?
