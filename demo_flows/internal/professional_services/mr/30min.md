[Opening]

Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MR demo focused on the Professional Services sector. Our goal today is to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively pitch Meraki MR to your customers. Let's dive in.

[Use Case 1: Secure Guest Wi-Fi]

Presenter: One common use case in the Professional Services sector is the need for secure guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up a separate SSID for guests, allowing them to connect while keeping your internal network secure. To do this, **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** and create a new SSID specifically for guests. You can then apply different security policies and bandwidth limits to this SSID to ensure a smooth and secure experience for your guests.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]

Presenter: Another valuable use case for Professional Services is leveraging location analytics to understand customer behavior and improve service delivery. With Meraki MR, you can track the movement of Wi-Fi-enabled devices within your premises, providing valuable insights into customer flow and behavior. **Click 'Wireless > Location analytics'** to access real-time data on device location and movement patterns. This information can help you optimize your space layout, staffing levels, and overall customer experience.

[Use Case 3: Remote Management]

Presenter: Lastly, remote management is crucial for Professional Services firms with multiple locations or remote workers. With Meraki MR, you can easily manage and monitor your entire network from a centralized dashboard. **Click 'Dashboard'** to view real-time network status, troubleshoot issues, and push out updates to all your Meraki MR devices. This level of visibility and control is essential for ensuring seamless operations across all your locations.
