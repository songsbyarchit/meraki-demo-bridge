You can troubleshoot issues, push updates, and ensure that your team is always productive, even when working from different locations.

For professional services firms handling sensitive client data, security compliance is crucial. With Meraki SM, you can enforce security policies and ensure that all devices are compliant with your company's security standards. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security > Compliance'** to set up custom compliance rules and receive alerts if any device falls out of compliance. This feature gives you peace of mind knowing that your client data is always protected.

Many professional services firms rely on specific business applications to deliver their services. With Meraki SM, you can easily manage and distribute these applications to all devices in your network. **Click 'Apps > Manage > Add App'** to see how simple it is to push updates or new applications to all your devices with just a few clicks. This feature saves you time and ensures that your team always has access to the tools they need to serve your clients effectively.
