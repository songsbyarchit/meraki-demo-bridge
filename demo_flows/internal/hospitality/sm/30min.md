[Opening]

Presenter: Welcome everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a demo of Meraki SM specifically tailored for the Hospitality sector. Our goal is to equip our partners with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively pitch Meraki SM to customers in this industry.

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Management]

Presenter: One of the key pain points in the Hospitality sector is managing guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki SM, partners can easily set up customizable splash pages, limit bandwidth usage, and even track guest usage patterns. Let's **click 'Configure > Wireless settings'** to see how easy it is to set up a guest network and apply different policies for guest users.

[Use Case 2: Device Monitoring and Security]

Presenter: In the Hospitality sector, keeping track of all the devices connected to the network and ensuring their security is crucial. With Meraki SM, partners can remotely monitor devices, push security updates, and even locate lost devices. Let's **click 'Monitor > Devices'** to see how partners can quickly identify and troubleshoot any issues with connected devices.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]

Presenter: Lastly, another common challenge in the Hospitality sector is the need for quick and efficient troubleshooting. With Meraki SM, partners can remotely access devices, run diagnostics, and even push configuration changes without being on-site. Let's **click 'Monitor > Remote desktop'** to see how partners can easily troubleshoot issues and provide support to customers from anywhere.

1. How do you currently handle guest Wi-Fi management in your Hospitality clients?
2. What are the biggest security concerns you've encountered when it comes to device management in this sector?
