Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, we're excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's SM solution can revolutionize networking in the Hospitality sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions:
- What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Hospitality sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're managing a hotel network with multiple locations. With Meraki's SM, you get a single pane of glass view of all your network devices. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time client activity across all sites. Isn't that convenient?

Next, let's talk about security. In the Hospitality sector, guest Wi-Fi security is crucial. With Meraki, you can easily create secure guest networks with different access policies. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to set up a new guest network in just a few clicks.

Now, let's explore how Meraki simplifies troubleshooting. Say a guest reports slow Wi-Fi in their room. **Click 'Wireless > Air Marshal'** to identify any rogue devices causing interference and quickly resolve the issue.

And that's just scratching the surface! With Meraki's SM, you can streamline network management, enhance security, and provide a seamless guest experience in the Hospitality sector.

Before we wrap up, here are a couple of FAQs to empower you in selling SM to Hospitality clients:
- **Q: What objections might the partner hear in hospitality?**  
  A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

- **Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?**  
  A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

- **Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?**  
  A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.
