Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE, I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MR solution can transform the way we approach networking in the Hospitality sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Hospitality sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the Hospitality sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into the demo. Today, we're focusing on the specific needs of the Hospitality sector. Imagine you're managing a hotel network. With Meraki's MR solution, you can easily set up guest Wi-Fi, monitor network performance, and ensure a seamless experience for both guests and staff.

Let's take a look at a couple of use cases:
1. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'**: Easily create separate SSIDs for guests and staff, with different access controls and bandwidth limits.
2. **Navigate to 'Network-wide > Clients'**: See real-time insights into who's connected to your network, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and ensure a smooth experience for everyone.

The Meraki Dashboard serves as your single pane of glass for network management. It provides visibility into your entire network, simplifies troubleshooting with intuitive tools, and enables unified management across all your devices.

Now, let's address a few internal enablement FAQs to support partners selling MR in the Hospitality space:
- Q: What objections might the partner hear in hospitality?
  A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

- Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
  A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

- Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
  A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thanks for joining me today. I hope this demo has given you a glimpse of how Meraki's MR solution can revolutionize networking in the Hospitality sector. Let's work together to empower our partners and customers with innovative networking solutions.
