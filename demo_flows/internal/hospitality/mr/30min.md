[Opening]

Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MR demo. Today, we're going to focus on how our Meraki MR solution can benefit the hospitality sector and how you, as partners, can effectively pitch this solution to potential customers. 

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi]

Presenter: Let's start with a common use case in the hospitality industry - providing reliable guest Wi-Fi. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up a separate guest network with customizable login portals. **Click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** to see how easy it is to create a new SSID for guests. This feature allows hotels to provide a seamless and secure Wi-Fi experience for their guests, enhancing their overall stay.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]

Presenter: Another valuable use case for hotels is location analytics. With Meraki MR, you can gather valuable insights about guest behavior and preferences by tracking their movement within the hotel premises. **Click 'Monitor > Location analytics'** to see real-time data on guest traffic patterns. This data can help hotels optimize their services and marketing strategies to better cater to their guests' needs.

[Use Case 3: Seamless Roaming]

Presenter: Lastly, let's talk about seamless roaming. In a hotel environment, guests often move around the premises while staying connected to the Wi-Fi network. With Meraki MR's seamless roaming capabilities, guests can transition between access points without experiencing any interruptions in their connection. This ensures a smooth and consistent Wi-Fi experience for guests throughout their stay.

[Prompted Questions]

Presenter: Now, I'd like to ask you all a couple of questions to prompt some discussion:

1. How do you currently address guest Wi-Fi needs in the hospitality sector?
2. Have you ever encountered challenges with gathering guest behavior data in hotels?
3. What features do you think are most important for hotels when it comes to Wi-Fi networks?

[Closing]

Presenter: Thank you for participating in today's demo. I hope you now have a better understanding of how Meraki MR can benefit the hospitality sector and how you can effectively pitch this solution to potential customers.
