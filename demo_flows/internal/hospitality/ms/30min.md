**Demo Script:**

Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki's MS solution and how it can benefit the Hospitality sector.

Let's kick things off with a question tailored to your role: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Hospitality sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're a partner reseller looking to pitch MS to a customer in the Hospitality sector. The Meraki Dashboard will be your best friend in this process. **Click 'Dashboard'** to see the single pane of glass that provides visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management.

One use case in Hospitality is ensuring seamless guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki MS, you can easily **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to monitor and manage access points across multiple locations.

Another key use case is network security. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security Center'** to view security events and settings, making it simple to ensure network integrity.

In the Hospitality sector, partners may encounter objections around cost compared to legacy vendors and skepticism over cloud-managed security. To address this, arm yourself with TCO comparisons and case studies showcasing successful deployments.

Additionally, we provide partners with access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars to support their sales efforts.

Post-sale, we offer onboarding support through co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and fast escalations handled by Meraki support.

I hope this demo has given you a glimpse of the powerful capabilities of Cisco Meraki's MS solution in the Hospitality sector. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need more information. Thanks for tuning in!
