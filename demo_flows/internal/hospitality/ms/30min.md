Another important aspect for hospitality businesses is providing reliable Wi-Fi in lobbies and public areas. With Meraki MS, hotels can easily set up multiple access points and manage them centrally. **Click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to see how you can monitor and troubleshoot access points in real-time. This ensures that guests have a seamless Wi-Fi experience throughout the hotel premises.
