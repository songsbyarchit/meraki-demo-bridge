[Opening]

Presenter: Welcome everyone to today's demo on Meraki MX for the Hospitality sector. Today, we'll be focusing on partner enablement and how to effectively pitch to customers in this industry. Let's dive in.

[Use Case 1: Secure Guest Wi-Fi]

Presenter: One common use case in the Hospitality sector is providing secure guest Wi-Fi. With Meraki MX, partners can easily set up a separate VLAN for guest Wi-Fi, ensuring that guest traffic is isolated from the internal network. This helps maintain security and compliance while providing a seamless guest experience.

**click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** 
**click 'Add a new SSID'**
**click 'Advanced settings'**
**select 'Use VLAN tagging'**
**enter VLAN ID for guest network**
**save changes**

[Use Case 2: Content Filtering]

Presenter: Another important use case for hotels and resorts is content filtering. With Meraki MX, partners can easily set up web filtering policies to block inappropriate content and ensure a safe browsing experience for guests. This can help hotels comply with regulations and protect their guests from malicious websites.

**click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'**
**configure web filtering policies**
**select categories to block**
**save changes**

[Use Case 3: Auto VPN for Multi-site Connectivity]

Presenter: Lastly, for hotels with multiple locations, Meraki MX offers a seamless solution for connecting multiple sites through Auto VPN. This feature simplifies the process of setting up secure site-to-site VPN connections, ensuring that all locations are securely connected and can easily share resources.

**click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'**
**enable Auto VPN**
**add new VPN peers for each site**
**save changes**

Presenter: Now, let's open up the floor for discussion. Here are a few questions to prompt conversation:

1. How do you currently address the challenges of providing secure guest Wi-Fi in the Hospitality sector?
2. Have you encountered any difficulties with content filtering in hotels or resorts, and how do you currently handle it?
