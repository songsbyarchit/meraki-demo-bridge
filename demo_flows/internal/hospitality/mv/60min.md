Great, let's dive into the demo. Today, I want to show you how Cisco Meraki MV can revolutionize the way Hospitality businesses manage their security cameras. As you know, the Hospitality sector has unique challenges when it comes to security and customer experience. With Meraki MV, we can address those challenges head-on.

Let's start by looking at the Meraki Dashboard. This is where you'll have a single pane of glass view of all your security cameras across multiple locations. **Click 'Cameras' on the left-hand menu**. Here, you can see a live feed of all your cameras, easily spot any issues, and troubleshoot in real-time.

Now, let's talk about some specific use cases for MV in Hospitality:
1. **Employee Safety**: With MV's advanced analytics, you can set up alerts for things like loitering or overcrowding in employee-only areas.
2. **Guest Experience**: Use MV cameras to monitor occupancy levels in common areas and optimize staffing accordingly.
3. **Loss Prevention**: Get instant alerts for suspicious activity like unauthorized access to restricted areas.
4. **Compliance**: Easily retrieve footage for compliance audits and investigations.

Moving on, let's talk about how MV simplifies troubleshooting. **Click on a specific camera feed**. Here, you can adjust settings, view historical footage, and even export clips with just a few clicks. No more digging through hours of footage or dealing with clunky interfaces.

Lastly, let's discuss unified management. **Navigate to the 'Network-wide' tab**. Here, you can see all your cameras, switches, and access points in one place. This centralized view makes it easy to ensure all your devices are up to date and secure.

Now, let's address some FAQs to help you pitch MV effectively in the Hospitality space:
Q: What objections might the partner hear in hospitality?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

That wraps up our demo. I hope you're as excited as I am about the potential of Cisco Meraki MV in the Hospitality sector. Thank you for joining me today.
