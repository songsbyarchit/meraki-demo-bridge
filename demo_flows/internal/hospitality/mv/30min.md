Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or an internal SE, I'm excited to walk you through our demo of Cisco Meraki MV tailored for the Hospitality sector.

To kick things off, I'd love to hear from our partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're a hotel manager looking to enhance guest safety and optimize operations. With Meraki MV, you can easily monitor common areas, parking lots, and back-of-house spaces through high-definition video feeds. **Navigate to the Meraki Dashboard and click 'Cameras > Live Video'** to see it in action.

Next, picture a resort wanting to streamline check-in processes. By integrating MV cameras with a custom app, staff can receive alerts when guests arrive and greet them promptly. **Go to the Dashboard and click 'Cameras > Motion Alerts'** to set this up.

Lastly, let's consider a restaurant chain aiming to improve customer service. MV's advanced analytics can track customer flow, wait times, and table turnover rates to optimize staffing and seating arrangements. **Click 'Cameras > Analytics' on the Dashboard** to explore these insights.

Now, let's address some common FAQs:
Q: What objections might the partner hear in hospitality?
A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?
A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?
A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast.

Thanks for joining me today. I hope you feel more equipped to pitch MV effectively in the Hospitality sector. Let's go out there and make a difference together!
