[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining today's Meraki MG demo focused on the Hospitality sector. Today, we'll be covering a range of use cases to help you better understand how the Meraki MG can benefit your customers in the hospitality industry.

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Access]

Let's start with one of the most common use cases in the hospitality sector - providing secure and reliable guest Wi-Fi access. With the Meraki MG, you can easily create a separate guest network with customizable splash pages and access controls. To set this up, simply **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** and configure the guest network settings.

[Use Case 2: VoIP Support]

Another important use case for hotels is providing VoIP support for guest rooms. With the Meraki MG, you can prioritize voice traffic over the network to ensure crystal-clear calls. To do this, **click 'Quality of Service > VoIP'** and configure the settings to prioritize voice traffic.

[Use Case 3: Video Surveillance Integration]

Hotels often have extensive video surveillance systems in place for security purposes. The Meraki MG can seamlessly integrate with these systems, allowing for easy monitoring and management of video feeds. To set this up, **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Cameras'** and add the IP cameras to the network.

[Use Case 4: IoT Device Management]

As hotels increasingly adopt IoT devices for smart room control and energy management, the Meraki MG can help manage and secure these devices on the network. With built-in security features, you can easily monitor and control IoT devices. To do this, **click 'Clients > IoT Devices'** and view a list of connected IoT devices.

1. How are you currently managing guest Wi-Fi access in your hotel?
2. Have you encountered any challenges with VoIP support in guest rooms?
3. Are you looking to integrate video surveillance systems with your network for better security?
