In the Healthcare sector, Meraki's SM shines in various use cases. For instance, with the need for secure and reliable connectivity in hospitals, SM offers seamless network management for medical devices, ensuring patient data privacy and compliance. Additionally, in clinics with multiple locations, the centralized dashboard simplifies network monitoring and troubleshooting, reducing downtime and improving patient care.

When positioning SM in Healthcare, partners often ask about the key pain points it addresses. Typically, lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites are the top concerns that Meraki solves. To best pitch SM, emphasize its ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security. For deployment concerns, it's usually plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
