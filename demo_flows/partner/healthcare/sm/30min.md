Hello and welcome, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about how Meraki SM can revolutionize the way healthcare organizations manage their network infrastructure. As partners, it's crucial to understand the pain points that healthcare customers face and how Meraki can address those challenges. Let's dive in.

[Pain Points]

Healthcare organizations often struggle with maintaining a secure and reliable network infrastructure. With the increasing number of connected devices and sensitive patient data being transferred, security is a top concern. Additionally, managing a complex network with limited IT resources can be overwhelming. This is where Meraki SM comes in.

[Use Case 1: Device Management]

Imagine a hospital with hundreds of medical devices scattered throughout the building. With Meraki SM, partners can easily enroll and manage all these devices from a centralized dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see real-time status updates, enforce security policies, and troubleshoot any issues remotely. This streamlines device management and ensures compliance with industry regulations.

[Use Case 2: Network Monitoring]

In a healthcare setting, network downtime is not an option. With Meraki SM, partners can proactively monitor the network health and performance. **Click 'Monitor > Overview'** to view real-time analytics and receive alerts for any potential issues. This allows IT teams to quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact patient care.

[Use Case 3: Application Control]

Healthcare organizations often have strict policies around which applications can be accessed on their network. With Meraki SM, partners can easily set up application control policies to restrict access to non-essential apps. **Click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies'** to configure rules based on user roles or device types. This ensures a secure and efficient network environment.
