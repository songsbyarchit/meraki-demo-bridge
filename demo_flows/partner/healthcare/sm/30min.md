Hey there, thanks for joining us today for this demo! I know we have a mix of partners in the audience, so let's kick things off with a couple of questions tailored to your perspective.

What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Healthcare sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's dive into the demo and explore how Cisco Meraki can address those challenges in the Healthcare sector.

**Use Case 1: Secure Guest Access**
Let's start by navigating to the Meraki Dashboard and **click 'Wireless > Configure > SSIDs'**. In the Healthcare industry, it's crucial to provide secure guest access for patients and visitors while keeping the network protected. With Meraki, you can easily set up a separate SSID for guests with customizable access policies to ensure network security.

**Use Case 2: Location Analytics**
Next, let's **click 'Wireless > Monitor > Location Analytics'**. Understanding patient flow and staff movement within a healthcare facility is essential for optimizing operations. Meraki's location analytics feature provides valuable insights into foot traffic patterns, helping healthcare providers make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency.

**Use Case 3: Remote Site Management**
Lastly, let's **click 'Organization > Inventory > Devices'**. Healthcare organizations often have multiple sites that need to be managed centrally. With Meraki's single pane of glass dashboard, you can easily monitor and configure network devices across different locations, simplifying troubleshooting and ensuring consistent network performance.

Now, let's wrap up with a few common questions partners might have when positioning SM in the Healthcare space.

Q: What are the top healthcare pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
