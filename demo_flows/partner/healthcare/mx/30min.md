[Opening]
Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MX demo tailored for the Healthcare sector. As partners, we understand the unique challenges that healthcare organizations face when it comes to network security, compliance, and scalability. Today, we'll show you how Meraki MX can address these pain points and help you pitch to healthcare customers effectively.

[Pain Points]
Presenter: In the healthcare sector, data security and compliance are top priorities. Healthcare organizations deal with sensitive patient information that must be protected at all costs. Network downtime can have serious consequences, affecting patient care and potentially putting lives at risk. Additionally, healthcare facilities are often spread out across multiple locations, making network management and scalability a challenge.

[Use Case 1: Secure Remote Access]
Presenter: Let's start with a common use case in healthcare - secure remote access for healthcare professionals. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up a secure VPN connection for remote employees, allowing them to access patient records and critical applications securely from anywhere. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'** to see how simple it is to configure.

[Use Case 2: Application Layer Visibility]
Presenter: Another key feature of Meraki MX is its deep packet inspection capabilities, providing application layer visibility into network traffic. This is crucial for healthcare organizations to monitor and control the use of applications that may pose security risks or violate compliance regulations. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Traffic analytics'** to see real-time insights into network traffic.

[Use Case 3: SD-WAN for Multi-site Healthcare Facilities]
Presenter: For healthcare organizations with multiple locations, Meraki MX offers a robust SD-WAN solution that ensures reliable connectivity and seamless failover between sites. This is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and delivering quality patient care across different facilities. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > SD-WAN & traffic shaping'** to explore the SD-WAN capabilities.
