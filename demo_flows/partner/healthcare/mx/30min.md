Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I know we have a lot to cover, so let's dive right in.

For partners in the healthcare sector, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Alright, let's talk about how Meraki MX can address some of these challenges in healthcare. Imagine a hospital struggling with network security across multiple locations. With Meraki MX, they can centralize network management through the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat Protection'** to see real-time security alerts and **click 'Clients'** to view connected devices across their sites.

Now, let's consider a healthcare clinic dealing with slow network performance impacting patient care. Meraki MX offers advanced traffic shaping and application control to prioritize critical applications. **Click 'SD-WAN & traffic shaping'** to adjust policies based on application type and **click 'Summary Report'** to see bandwidth usage in real-time.

Lastly, picture a healthcare provider facing compliance challenges due to lack of network visibility. Meraki MX provides detailed analytics and reporting for auditing purposes. **Click 'Overview > Summary Report'** to generate customizable reports and **click 'Monitor > Network-wide > Clients'** to track network activity.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning Meraki MX in the healthcare sector:

Q: What are the top healthcare pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MX during the pitch?  
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
