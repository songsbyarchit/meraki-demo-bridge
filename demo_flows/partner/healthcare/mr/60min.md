[Pain Points]

Now, let's talk about some of the pain points that healthcare customers care about. Security and compliance are top of mind for these organizations, as they handle sensitive patient data that must be protected at all costs. Additionally, with the rise of IoT devices in healthcare settings, there is a need for a network solution that can handle the increasing number of connected devices while maintaining performance and reliability. Lastly, healthcare organizations often have limited IT resources and budgets, so they need a solution that is easy to manage and cost-effective.
