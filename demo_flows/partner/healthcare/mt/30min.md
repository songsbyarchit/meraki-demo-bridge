Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's get started. In the Healthcare sector, one of the biggest pain points we often hear about is the need for better visibility and management across multiple sites. With Cisco Meraki, we can address these challenges by providing a single pane of glass through the Meraki Dashboard. This allows for simplified troubleshooting, unified management, and overall increased efficiency.

Let's walk through a couple of specific use cases to see how this plays out in real-world scenarios. First, let's **click 'Monitor > Clients'** on the Meraki Dashboard. Here, you can see all the devices connected to your network in real-time, allowing you to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise.

Next, let's **navigate to 'Wireless > Access Points'** on the dashboard. Here, you can easily manage and configure your wireless network across multiple sites, ensuring a seamless and secure connection for both staff and patients.

Lastly, let's **click 'Security > Cameras'** to see how you can monitor and secure your physical spaces using Meraki cameras. This added layer of security is crucial in the Healthcare sector to protect sensitive information and ensure a safe environment for all.

Now, as you're talking to customers in the Healthcare space, you may encounter a few common questions. Here are a couple of key ones to keep in mind:
