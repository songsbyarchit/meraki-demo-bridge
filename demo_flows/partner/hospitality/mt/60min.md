[Opening]

Hello and welcome, partners! Today, we're going to dive into a Meraki MT demo specifically tailored for the Hospitality sector. We'll cover some key pain points that customers in this industry care about and how to position Meraki as the solution. Let's get started!

[Pain Points]

Customers in the Hospitality sector often face challenges with managing a large number of guest devices on their network, ensuring seamless connectivity in public areas, and maintaining network security to protect guest data. These pain points can lead to slow or unreliable Wi-Fi, potential security breaches, and ultimately, a negative guest experience.

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Management]

One of the key features of Meraki MT is the ability to easily set up and manage guest Wi-Fi networks. With Meraki, partners can **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a separate guest network with customizable login pages and bandwidth limits. This ensures that guests have a secure and reliable connection without impacting the main network.

[Use Case 2: Public Area Connectivity]

For hotels with public areas like lobbies or conference rooms, ensuring seamless connectivity is crucial. Partners can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to prioritize bandwidth for these areas or set up access controls to limit unauthorized access. This helps to optimize network performance and enhance the guest experience.

[Use Case 3: Network Security]

Network security is a top priority for Hospitality customers, given the sensitive guest data that flows through their networks. With Meraki MT, partners can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'** to set up content filtering and block malicious websites. Additionally, partners can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat protection'** to enable advanced security features like intrusion detection and prevention to protect against cyber threats.

[Use Case 4: Remote Management]

Managing multiple hotel locations can be challenging, especially when it comes to network maintenance and troubleshooting. With Meraki MT, partners can **click 'Organization > Inventory'** to view all devices across different locations and **click 'Organization > Network-wide settings'** to push configurations or updates remotely. This simplifies network management and reduces the need for on-site visits.
