And for our internal team, what common questions do our customers ask in the hospitality sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Let's start by exploring a common use case in hospitality: ensuring guest safety and security. With Meraki MV, you can easily monitor all areas of your hotel or resort in real-time, from the lobby to the parking lot. **Navigate to the MV Dashboard and click on 'Cameras' to view all connected devices.** The centralized dashboard provides a single pane of glass view, allowing you to quickly spot any potential security issues and take immediate action.

Another key use case is enhancing operational efficiency. Imagine being able to remotely check on housekeeping progress or monitor crowd flow in the restaurant during peak hours. **Click on 'Heat Maps' to visualize high-traffic areas and optimize staff deployment accordingly.** With Meraki MV, you can proactively manage your hospitality operations with ease.

Now, let's address some common partner questions:

Q: What are the top hospitality pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MV during the pitch?  
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
