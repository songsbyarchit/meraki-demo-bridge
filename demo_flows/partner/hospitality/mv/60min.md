[Opening]

Welcome everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a demo of the Meraki MV for the Hospitality sector. As partners, it's crucial to understand the pain points our customers in this industry face and how Meraki can help address them.

[Pain points]

One major pain point in the Hospitality sector is ensuring the safety and security of guests and staff. Traditional CCTV systems can be costly to install and maintain, not to mention they often lack the intelligence needed to proactively prevent incidents.

Another pain point is the need for seamless integration with other hotel systems, like access control and guest Wi-Fi. Guests expect a connected experience, and hotels need a solution that can easily integrate with their existing infrastructure.

[Use cases]

Let's explore some use cases to demonstrate how Meraki MV can help address these pain points:

1. **Enhanced Security:** With Meraki MV's advanced analytics, hotels can proactively monitor and detect suspicious behavior, such as loitering in restricted areas or unauthorized access to guest rooms.

2. **Occupancy Insights:** By leveraging MV's people counting feature, hotels can better understand guest flow and occupancy levels, allowing them to optimize staffing and resource allocation.

3. **Integration with Access Control:** MV cameras can easily integrate with access control systems, allowing hotels to automatically grant or deny access based on visual verification from the cameras.

4. **Remote Monitoring:** With the Meraki dashboard, hotel staff can remotely monitor live video feeds from anywhere, ensuring around-the-clock security and peace of mind.

[Smart questions]

Now, here are a few smart questions you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently addressing security challenges at your properties, and what are the pain points you're experiencing with your current solution?
2. Can you walk me through your current system integration process and highlight any pain points or challenges you've encountered?
3. How do you see the role of video surveillance evolving in the Hospitality sector, and what features or capabilities are most important to you?

By understanding your customers' pain points and demonstrating how Meraki MV can address them with real-world use cases, you'll be better equipped to pitch to them effectively. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to helping you succeed in the Hospitality market with Meraki MV.
