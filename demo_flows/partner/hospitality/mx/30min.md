Hey there, thanks for joining us today. I know you're a partner in the tech industry, so I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MX can really make a difference for your customers in the Hospitality sector. What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this space lately? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions here?

Let's dive into the demo now. Imagine you're working with a hotel chain that needs to manage multiple locations and ensure seamless connectivity for guests. With Meraki MX, you can provide them with a solid solution that offers centralized management and visibility across all sites.

One key use case is setting up secure guest Wi-Fi access. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** on the Dashboard to create a separate network for guests with limited access, ensuring their privacy while keeping your network secure.

Another scenario is managing VPN connections for remote employees or connecting multiple branches. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'** to easily configure secure connections between different locations, all from one central location.

Lastly, let's talk about network analytics. **Click 'Monitor > Appliance status'** to see real-time data on network performance and troubleshoot any issues quickly and efficiently, all from the Meraki Dashboard.

As a partner, you might wonder about the top pain points this solution addresses. In Hospitality, it's usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites. By emphasizing Meraki's ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security, you can really make an impact during your pitch.

And when it comes to installation or deployment concerns, it's typically plug-and-play. Just ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready to go to streamline the process for your customers. Thanks for tuning in today, and feel free to reach out with any further questions.
