[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MX demo targeted towards the Hospitality sector. As partners, we understand the unique challenges and pain points that customers in this industry face, and we're here to show you how Meraki can help solve those issues and provide value to your customers. 

Let's dive right in and start by discussing some of the common pain points that Hospitality customers care about:

1. Network security: With the increasing number of connected devices in hotels, ensuring a secure network is crucial to protect guest data and maintain compliance with industry regulations.
2. Network reliability: Guests expect seamless connectivity for their devices, and any downtime can result in negative reviews and loss of business.
3. Network management complexity: Hospitality IT teams often have limited resources and need a solution that is easy to deploy and manage.

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi]

Let's start with a common use case in the Hospitality sector - providing secure and reliable guest Wi-Fi. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up a dedicated guest network with a captive portal for guests to log in. This not only provides a seamless onboarding experience for guests but also allows you to enforce security policies to protect your network.

**Click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs' to set up a new guest network.**

[Use Case 2: Remote Site Management]

Another pain point for Hospitality customers is managing multiple sites remotely. With Meraki MX, you can centrally manage all your MX appliances through the Meraki dashboard, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot issues across multiple locations. This not only saves time and resources but also provides a consistent experience for guests at all your properties.

**Click 'Monitor > Appliance status' to view the health of all your MX appliances.**

[Use Case 3: Application Control]

Finally, let's talk about application control. Hospitality customers often struggle to prioritize bandwidth for essential applications like booking systems or POS terminals. With Meraki MX, you can easily prioritize traffic based on application type, ensuring that critical applications always have the necessary bandwidth to function smoothly.

**Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Traffic shaping' to prioritize traffic for specific applications.**

[Closing]

As you can see, Meraki MX offers a comprehensive solution to address the pain points faced by Hospitality customers, from network security to remote management and application control. When pitching to customers, make sure to highlight these key benefits and show how Meraki can help improve their overall guest experience.

Before we wrap up, here are a few smart questions you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently manage your network security and ensure compliance with industry regulations?
2. Have you experienced any challenges with providing reliable Wi-Fi for your guests, and how do you currently address those issues?
3. How do you currently monitor and troubleshoot issues across multiple sites, and what improvements would you like to see in your network management approach?

Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to helping you successfully pitch Meraki MX to your Hospitality customers. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us for more information.
