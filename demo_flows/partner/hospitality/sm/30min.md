Hey there, **Partner**! Thanks for joining us today for this demo on Cisco Meraki's **SM** solution tailored for the Hospitality sector. I'm excited to show you how Meraki can address the unique challenges in this industry. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you - what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great insights! Now let's explore how Meraki can help. In the Hospitality sector, ensuring reliable Wi-Fi for guests is crucial. With Meraki's **SM**, you can easily manage multiple sites from a single dashboard, providing visibility into network performance and simplifying troubleshooting. Let's take a look at how this works in action.

First, let's **navigate to 'Wireless > Access points'** on the Meraki Dashboard. Here, you can see all your access points across different locations, allowing you to quickly identify any performance issues or connectivity issues.

Next, let's **click 'Network-wide > Clients'**. This gives you a comprehensive view of all connected clients, making it easy to monitor guest devices and ensure a seamless Wi-Fi experience.

Another key feature for Hospitality is the ability to create customized guest Wi-Fi splash pages. With **SM**, you can easily **click 'Wireless > Splash pages'** to design and manage guest authentication pages, enhancing the guest experience while ensuring network security.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning Meraki in the Hospitality space:

Q: What are the top hospitality pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
