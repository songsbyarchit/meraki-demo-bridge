[Opening]

Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MR demo tailored for the Hospitality sector. As partners, we understand the unique challenges that hotels and resorts face when it comes to providing reliable and secure Wi-Fi to their guests. Today, we will show you how Meraki MR can address these pain points and help you pitch to your customers effectively.

[Pain Points]

Let's start by discussing some of the key pain points that customers in the Hospitality sector care about. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring seamless connectivity for guests, who expect fast and reliable Wi-Fi during their stay. Additionally, hotel IT teams often struggle with managing multiple access points across large properties, leading to inefficiencies and potential downtime. Security is also a top concern, as hotels need to protect guest data and prevent unauthorized access to their network.

[Meraki Positioning]

This is where Meraki MR comes in. With its cloud-managed architecture, Meraki MR offers centralized management and visibility across all access points, making it easy to deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot Wi-Fi networks in real-time. The intuitive dashboard allows IT teams to **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** and make changes quickly, without the need for complex configurations or on-site visits. Meraki also prioritizes security, with built-in features such as integrated firewall and advanced threat protection to safeguard guest data and network integrity.

[Use Cases]

Now, let's dive into a couple of use cases to demonstrate the power of Meraki MR in the Hospitality sector.

1. Guest Room Wi-Fi: Imagine a scenario where a guest encounters slow Wi-Fi in their room. With Meraki MR, IT teams can easily identify the issue through the dashboard, **click 'Wireless > Clients'** to pinpoint the specific access point causing the problem, and **click 'Configure > Radio settings'** to optimize performance without disrupting other guests' connections.

2. Conference Center Network: In a busy conference center, where multiple events are taking place simultaneously, Meraki MR can ensure seamless connectivity for all attendees. IT teams can **click 'Wireless > Access points'** to adjust bandwidth allocation, prioritize traffic for video conferencing, and monitor network usage in real-time to prevent congestion.
