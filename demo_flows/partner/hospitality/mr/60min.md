[Opening]
Good morning/afternoon everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MR demo tailored for the Hospitality sector. As partners, we understand the unique challenges that hotels and resorts face when it comes to providing reliable and secure Wi-Fi to their guests. Today, we will show you how Meraki MR can address these pain points and help you pitch to customers effectively.

[Pain Points]
- Slow or unreliable Wi-Fi: Guests expect fast and seamless connectivity for work and leisure. A poor Wi-Fi experience can lead to negative reviews and lost business.
- Security concerns: Hotels need to safeguard guest data and prevent unauthorized access to the network.
- Limited IT resources: Many hospitality businesses have limited IT staff who are responsible for managing the network along with other duties.

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi]
Let's start with one of the most critical use cases for the Hospitality sector - providing a secure and reliable guest Wi-Fi network. With Meraki MR, setting up a guest network is as simple as **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'**. You can easily create multiple SSIDs for different user groups and apply customized access policies to ensure a seamless and secure experience for guests.

[Use Case 2: Location Analytics]
Another key feature of Meraki MR is the ability to gather location analytics. By **clicking 'Wireless > Access Points > Location Analytics'**, you can track guest movements within the property, identify high-traffic areas, and optimize the layout for better guest experience and operational efficiency.

[Use Case 3: Application Visibility]
With Meraki MR, you can also gain insights into the applications consuming the most bandwidth on your network. By **clicking 'Wireless > Access Points > Application Visibility'**, you can prioritize critical applications, such as video conferencing or streaming, to ensure a seamless experience for guests.

[Use Case 4: Guest Authentication]
One of the pain points in the Hospitality sector is managing guest authentication. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up a captive portal for guests to authenticate before accessing the network. By **clicking 'Wireless > Configure > Access Control'**, you can customize the authentication process and collect valuable guest data for marketing purposes.

[Use Case 5: Remote Troubleshooting]
In the event of network issues, IT staff can remotely troubleshoot and resolve problems with Meraki MR. By **clicking 'Wireless > Monitor > Clients'**, you can identify and address connectivity issues without having to be on-site, saving time and resources.

[Use Case 6: Guest Satisfaction Surveys]
Lastly, Meraki MR allows you to gather feedback from guests through satisfaction surveys. By **clicking 'Wireless > Configure > Splash page'**, you can create custom surveys to measure guest satisfaction and improve service delivery.
