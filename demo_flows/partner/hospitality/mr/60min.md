Hey there, [Partner]! Thanks for joining us today for this demo on Cisco Meraki and how it can benefit your customers in the Hospitality sector. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Alright, let's get started. Imagine you're working with a hotel chain that wants to enhance their guest Wi-Fi experience. With Meraki MR, you can easily set up a branded guest Wi-Fi portal that captures user data and offers seamless connectivity throughout the property. **Click 'Wireless > Access points'** to see the network in action.

Next, let's address the issue of network security in a busy hotel environment. Meraki's built-in security features, such as integrated firewall and content filtering, help protect guest data and ensure compliance with regulations. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to configure security policies.

Now, let's talk about scalability. Whether your customer has one hotel or a chain of properties, managing multiple sites is a breeze with the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Organizations > Inventory'** to see all network devices across different locations and easily make configuration changes.

One of the biggest pain points for hotel IT teams is troubleshooting network issues quickly and efficiently. With Meraki, you can leverage real-time monitoring and alerts to identify and resolve issues before they impact guests. **Check the 'Network-wide > Clients' tab** to see real-time client information.

Moving on to guest room automation, Meraki MR can integrate with IoT devices to control smart thermostats, lights, and locks. **Explore 'Wireless > Bluetooth & Beacon'** to see how Meraki enables seamless connectivity for IoT devices throughout the hotel.

Lastly, let's discuss the importance of analytics in the Hospitality sector. Meraki's centralized dashboard provides valuable insights into network performance, user behavior, and trends that can help your customers make data-driven decisions to improve guest satisfaction. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to view client behavior and usage patterns.

Now, let's address some common questions you might encounter when pitching Meraki MR in the Hospitality space:

Q: What are the top hospitality pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

That's a wrap for our demo today. Thank you for your time and insights. We look forward to helping you empower your customers in the Hospitality sector with Cisco Meraki MR.
