[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MS demo tailored for the Hospitality sector. Today, we will be showcasing how Meraki can address the pain points that customers in this industry care about. As partners, it's essential for you to understand these pain points and effectively position Meraki as the solution. Let's dive in.

[Pain Points]

One of the biggest pain points in the Hospitality sector is the need for reliable and secure network connectivity. Guests expect fast and seamless Wi-Fi access throughout their stay, and any downtime can lead to negative reviews and loss of business. With Meraki, partners can offer a robust network solution that ensures high-speed connectivity and easy management.

Another pain point is the complexity of managing multiple locations. Hotels and resorts often have multiple buildings and facilities that require separate network configurations. Meraki's centralized dashboard allows partners to easily manage and monitor all locations from one interface, simplifying network management across the entire property.

[Use Cases]

1. **Guest Room Wi-Fi Management**: Show how partners can easily create separate VLANs for guest rooms, allowing for secure and isolated network access. Highlight the ability to set bandwidth limits and create custom splash pages for guests to access the Wi-Fi network.

2. **Lobby and Public Area Network**: Demonstrate how partners can set up access points in common areas like lobbies, restaurants, and conference rooms to provide seamless connectivity for guests and staff. Show how partners can easily manage access controls and monitor network usage in these public spaces.

3. **VoIP and IP Camera Integration**: Showcase how partners can integrate VoIP phones and IP cameras into the Meraki network for enhanced communication and security. Highlight the ease of setting up Quality of Service (QoS) policies to prioritize voice and video traffic for a seamless experience.

4. **Meraki Location Analytics**: Illustrate how partners can leverage Meraki's location analytics feature to track guest movement throughout the property. Show how this data can be used to optimize layout design, improve guest experience, and drive targeted marketing campaigns.

1. How important is network reliability and security to your guests' overall experience?
2. Have you faced any challenges with managing multiple network locations in the past?
