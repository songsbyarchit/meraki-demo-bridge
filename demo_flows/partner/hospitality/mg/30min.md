Hey there, thank you for joining me today. I know you're a partner reseller working in the Hospitality sector, and our goal today is to equip you with the tools and knowledge to effectively pitch Cisco Meraki's MG solution to your customers.

To kick things off, I'd love to hear from you about any trends or challenges you've been noticing with customers in the Hospitality sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's dive into the demo. Imagine you're meeting with a hotel owner who is struggling with network management across multiple properties. With Meraki's MG solution, you can offer them centralized visibility and control through the Meraki Dashboard.

Let's explore a few key use cases:
1. **Centralized Management**: **Navigate to 'Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time client activity across all sites.
2. **Secure Guest Wi-Fi**: **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to easily create a separate network for guests with custom splash pages and access controls.
3. **Network Troubleshooting**: **Go to 'Tools > Ping'** to troubleshoot connectivity issues remotely without needing to be on-site.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MG in the Hospitality space:
Q: What are the top hospitality pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MG during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for your time today. I hope this demo has given you a clear understanding of how Cisco Meraki's MG solution can meet the unique needs of customers in the Hospitality sector. Let's go out there and make some impactful pitches!
