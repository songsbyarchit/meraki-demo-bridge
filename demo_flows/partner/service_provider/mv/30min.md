This enhances security and ensures a safe environment for students or employees.

Construction sites often face security challenges due to their remote locations. Service Providers can position Meraki MV as a solution for monitoring construction sites 24/7. By **clicking 'Configure > Camera Feed'**, customers can access live video feeds and recordings to ensure site safety and prevent theft or vandalism.
