Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I know you're a partner in the Service Provider sector, and our goal for this demo is to help you pitch Cisco Meraki's MV solution to your customers. 

To kick things off, I'd love to hear from you about the trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Alright, let's dive into it! Imagine you're a service provider looking to enhance your video surveillance offerings. With Meraki MV, you can provide your customers with a cloud-managed solution that offers seamless integration and centralized management. 

Let's look at a few key use cases:

1. **Centralized Management**: With Meraki's intuitive dashboard, you can easily monitor and manage all your cameras from a single pane of glass. **Click on 'Cameras > Overview' to see all your cameras at a glance.**

2. **Motion Search**: Say goodbye to hours of manual footage review. Meraki MV's motion search feature allows you to quickly find specific events by filtering based on motion. **Click 'Cameras > Motion Search' and select the desired parameters to narrow down your search.**

3. **Smart Alerts**: Receive notifications for important events, such as motion detection or camera tampering. These alerts can be customized to suit your specific needs. **Navigate to 'Alerts > Motion Alerts' to configure your notifications.**

Now, let's address a couple of common questions you might encounter when pitching MV in the Service Provider space:

Q: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MV during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready. 

Thanks for walking through the demo with me today. I hope you feel more confident in positioning Meraki MV to your customers in the Service Provider sector. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification.
