Hey there, partners! Thanks for joining us today for this demo on Cisco Meraki's MR product. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you: what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Service Provider sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

**Use Case 1: Multi-site Management**  
Imagine you're a service provider with multiple client locations. With Meraki's Dashboard, you can easily manage all these sites from one central platform. **Navigate to 'Monitor > Overview'** to see a snapshot of all your network locations at a glance.

**Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Provisioning**  
Service providers often need to set up secure guest networks for their clients. With Meraki, **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to quickly create a separate guest network with custom access controls. It's that easy!

**Use Case 3: Troubleshooting Made Simple**  
When issues arise, time is of the essence. With Meraki's intuitive Dashboard, **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to identify and troubleshoot network problems in real-time, all from one place.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MR in the Service Provider space:

Q: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?  
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
