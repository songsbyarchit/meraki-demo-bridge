[Opening]

Hello and welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a demo of Meraki MR, specifically looking at how it can benefit service providers. As partners, it's crucial to understand the pain points that customers in this sector face and how Meraki can address them. Let's get started!

[Slide 1: Pain Points in Service Provider Sector]

Before we jump into the demo, let's talk about some common pain points that service providers care about. These include managing multiple locations, ensuring network security, providing reliable connectivity, and optimizing network performance. These are the areas where Meraki can truly shine.

[Slide 2: Use Case 1 - Centralized Management]

One of the key features of Meraki MR is its centralized management. With the Meraki dashboard, service providers can easily **click 'Configure > Wireless > Access points'** to manage all their Meraki MR devices from a single pane of glass. This simplifies network management and reduces the need for on-site visits.

[Slide 3: Use Case 2 - Network Security]

Security is a top concern for service providers. With Meraki MR, you can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to set up firewall rules and intrusion prevention to protect your network. Additionally, features like advanced malware protection and content filtering help keep your network secure.

[Slide 4: Use Case 3 - Reliable Connectivity]

Service providers need to ensure reliable connectivity for their customers. With features like seamless roaming and automatic RF optimization, Meraki MR ensures that devices stay connected and perform at their best. You can **click 'Wireless > RF Profiles'** to configure RF optimization settings for each access point.

[Slide 5: Use Case 4 - Performance Optimization]

Optimizing network performance is crucial for service providers. With Meraki MR, you can **click 'Wireless > Traffic Shaping'** to prioritize critical applications and ensure a consistent user experience. Dynamic channel selection and band steering further enhance performance across the network.

[Slide 6: Use Case 5 - Guest Access Management]

Many service providers offer guest Wi-Fi access to their customers. With Meraki MR, you can **click 'Wireless > Splash page'** to create customized guest portals and set up guest access policies. This not only enhances the customer experience but also keeps the main network secure.

[Slide 7: Use Case 6 - Analytics and Reporting]

Understanding network usage and performance is essential for service providers. With Meraki MR, you can **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to access real-time client information and **click 'Wireless > Analytics'** to view detailed network analytics. This data helps service providers make informed decisions and troubleshoot issues quickly.
