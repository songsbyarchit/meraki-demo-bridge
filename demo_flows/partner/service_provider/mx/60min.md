Hey there, thanks for joining me today! I'm excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki and how our MX solution can revolutionize the way service providers manage their networks. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you - what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the service provider sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's jump into the demo. Imagine you're a service provider looking to simplify network management across multiple sites. With Meraki MX, you can easily achieve that and more. Let's take a look at some key use cases:

1. **Setting up a new branch office**: **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'** to quickly establish secure connections between sites.
   
2. **Monitoring network performance**: **click 'Monitor > Performance'** to get real-time insights into traffic patterns and bandwidth usage.
   
3. **Implementing security policies**: **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to easily create and enforce policies across all sites.
   
4. **Troubleshooting network issues**: **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to identify and resolve connectivity problems in no time.
   
5. **Managing multiple sites**: **click 'Organization > Inventory'** to view and configure all your MX devices in one place.
   
6. **Ensuring compliance**: **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'** to enforce web usage policies across all sites.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching MX in the service provider space:

Q: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MX during the pitch?  
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for exploring Meraki MX with me today. I hope you can see the immense value it brings to service providers. Let's continue to simplify network management and drive success together.
