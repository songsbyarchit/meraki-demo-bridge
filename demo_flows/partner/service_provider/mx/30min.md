Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo on Cisco Meraki MX. I know you're a partner in the service provider sector, so I'm excited to show you how Meraki can help you pitch to customers in this space.

Before we dive in, could you share with me any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in the service provider sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's jump into the demo. Imagine you're meeting with a service provider customer who is struggling with visibility, troubleshooting, and managing multiple sites. That's where Meraki MX comes in.

Let's start by logging into the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Login' and enter your credentials**. As a service provider, you'll appreciate the single pane of glass view that the Dashboard offers. It gives you visibility into all your networks, simplifies troubleshooting, and allows for unified management.

Now, let's look at a specific use case. Imagine a customer with multiple branch locations. With Meraki MX, you can easily deploy and manage these sites from one central location. **Click 'Configure > Sites' to see all your locations**.

Another pain point service providers often face is security. Meraki MX offers built-in security features like Auto VPN and content filtering to help keep your network secure. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering' to configure your security settings**.

Lastly, let's talk about scalability. As a service provider, you need a solution that can grow with your customers. Meraki MX is easily scalable, allowing you to add new sites or devices with just a few clicks. **Click 'Add a device' to see how simple it is**.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MX in the service provider space:

Q: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MX during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining me on this demo. I hope you're now equipped to pitch Meraki MX to your service provider customers with confidence. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance.
