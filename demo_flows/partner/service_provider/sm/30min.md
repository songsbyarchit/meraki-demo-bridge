Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to talk to you about how Cisco Meraki can help address the unique challenges faced by Service Providers.

So, let's dive in. **Click 'Dashboard'** and take a look at how Meraki can simplify your network management. With Meraki, you get a single pane of glass view that provides visibility across all your sites. No more jumping between different platforms or struggling with complex configurations.

**Click 'Clients'** to see how easy it is to troubleshoot network issues. You can quickly identify problematic devices and take action to resolve issues in real-time. This level of visibility and control is crucial for Service Providers who need to ensure their networks are running smoothly.

Now, let's talk about some specific use cases. **Click 'Security Center'** to see how Meraki can help you implement security policies across all your sites with just a few clicks. This is especially important in the Service Provider sector where data protection is a top priority.

Another use case is **clicking 'Templates'** to show how you can easily deploy consistent network configurations across multiple sites. This saves time and reduces the risk of human error, making network management more efficient and reliable.

Now, let's address some common questions you might encounter when pitching Meraki SM to Service Providers:

Q: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

That's a wrap! I hope this demo has given you a clear understanding of how Cisco Meraki can help Service Providers streamline their network management. Thank you for your time and feel free to reach out with any further questions.
