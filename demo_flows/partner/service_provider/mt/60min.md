Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo. I know you're a partner in the service provider sector, so I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MT can help you address the challenges your customers are facing. Before we dive in, can you share what trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's get started. So, in the service provider sector, one of the biggest pain points customers care about is the lack of visibility and control across their network infrastructure. With Meraki's MT, we can offer a solution that provides a single pane of glass through the Meraki Dashboard. This allows for simplified troubleshooting, unified management, and enhanced visibility into network performance.

Now, let's walk through some specific use cases that highlight the benefits of Meraki MT for service providers. 

1. **View Network Health**: Let's start by logging into the Meraki Dashboard. Click on **Network-wide > Overview** to see a snapshot of your entire network's health status at a glance.

2. **Remote Site Management**: Navigate to **Monitor > Sites** to easily manage and monitor multiple sites from a centralized location.

3. **Traffic Analysis**: Click on **Monitor > Traffic Analytics** to gain insights into network traffic patterns and application usage.

4. **Security Policies**: Head to **Security & SD-WAN > Firewall** to configure security policies and ensure network protection.

Now, let's address a couple of common questions you might encounter when pitching Meraki MT in the service provider space:

Q: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MT during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki's ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It's typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

I hope this demo has given you a good sense of how Meraki MT can benefit service providers. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. Thanks for your time!
