Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. I'm excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki's MS product, specifically tailored for the Service Provider sector. 

So, let me ask you, as a partner reseller, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's dive in. Imagine you're a service provider looking to streamline your network management across multiple client sites. With Meraki MS, you can easily achieve this through the intuitive Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Dashboard > Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time client activity across all sites.

Now, let's consider a common pain point for service providers: troubleshooting network issues. With Meraki MS, you have complete visibility into each network device. **Click 'Dashboard > Network-wide > Monitor > Switches'** to quickly identify any connectivity issues and resolve them in minutes.

Another key use case for service providers is managing network security policies. **Click 'Dashboard > Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to easily configure and enforce security policies across all client sites, ensuring consistent protection against threats.

Partner: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Partner: How do we best position MS during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Partner: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
