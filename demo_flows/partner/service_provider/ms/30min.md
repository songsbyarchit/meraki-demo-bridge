[Opening]

1. Introduction: Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MS demo tailored for Service Providers. I'm excited to show you how Meraki can help address the pain points that your customers in the Service Provider sector care about.

2. Pain points: Service Providers often face challenges such as complex network management, limited visibility into network performance, and the need for scalability and flexibility. These pain points can result in increased costs, operational inefficiencies, and ultimately, unhappy customers.

3. Positioning Meraki: Meraki offers a cloud-managed networking solution that simplifies network management, provides real-time visibility into network performance, and scales easily to meet the needs of Service Providers and their customers. With Meraki, you can offer a reliable and secure network that is easy to deploy and manage, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and reducing operational costs.

[Use Case 1: Network Deployment]

4. Use Case 1 - Network Deployment: Let's say a Service Provider needs to deploy a new network for a customer quickly and efficiently. With Meraki, you can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to easily set up and configure network devices remotely. This simplifies the deployment process and reduces the time and effort required to get the network up and running.

[Use Case 2: Network Monitoring]

5. Use Case 2 - Network Monitoring: Another common pain point for Service Providers is the lack of visibility into network performance. With Meraki, you can **click 'Monitor > Network-wide > Performance**' to access real-time data on network traffic, bandwidth usage, and device connectivity. This visibility allows you to proactively identify and address any issues before they impact your customers.

[Use Case 3: Network Security]

6. Use Case 3 - Network Security: Security is a top concern for Service Providers and their customers. With Meraki, you can **click 'Security > Firewall & traffic shaping'** to easily configure firewall rules and traffic shaping policies to protect the network from cyber threats. Meraki's built-in security features help ensure that your customers' data is safe and secure.

7. Smart Questions:

- How important is network visibility and performance monitoring to your customers?
- Are your customers looking for a network solution that is easy to deploy and manage?
- What are the biggest security concerns that your customers have when it comes to their network?
