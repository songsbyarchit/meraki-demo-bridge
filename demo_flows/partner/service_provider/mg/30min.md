[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this demo of the Meraki MG targeting the Service Provider sector. As partners, we understand the challenges you face in pitching new solutions to your customers and we believe that Meraki can help you address their pain points effectively. 

[Pain Points]

Now, let's talk about the pain points that customers in the Service Provider sector care about. One of the biggest challenges they face is managing a large number of network devices across different locations efficiently. This can be time-consuming and costly, especially when it comes to troubleshooting issues remotely. Customers also want to ensure a seamless user experience for their end-users, which can be difficult to achieve with traditional networking solutions. 

[Positioning Meraki]

This is where Meraki comes in. Meraki offers a cloud-managed solution that simplifies network management and provides visibility and control over the entire network infrastructure. With Meraki, service providers can easily monitor and troubleshoot network devices from a centralized dashboard, saving time and resources. Additionally, the built-in analytics and reporting tools help service providers proactively identify and address network issues before they impact end-users. 

[Use Case 1: Remote Troubleshooting]

Let's look at a use case to better understand how Meraki can help service providers. Imagine a customer with multiple branch locations experiencing network connectivity issues. With Meraki, service providers can **click 'Devices > Network-wide > Connectivity'** to quickly identify the root cause of the problem and **click 'Tools > Ping'** to troubleshoot the connectivity between devices. This allows service providers to resolve issues remotely without the need for on-site visits, saving time and resources.

[Use Case 2: Quality of Service]

Another common pain point for service providers is ensuring quality of service for their customers. With Meraki, service providers can easily prioritize traffic and allocate bandwidth based on specific applications or users. By **clicking 'Configure > Traffic Shaping'**, service providers can set up policies to prioritize critical applications, such as VoIP or video conferencing, ensuring a seamless user experience for customers.

[Use Case 3: Security]

Security is a top concern for customers in the Service Provider sector. Meraki offers built-in security features, such as intrusion detection and prevention, content filtering, and VPN capabilities, to help service providers protect their network infrastructure and data. By **clicking 'Security > Threat Protection'**, service providers can monitor and block suspicious traffic in real-time, enhancing the overall security posture of their network.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with potential customers, here are two smart questions you can ask:
1. How are you currently managing your network infrastructure across multiple locations?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face in ensuring quality of service for your customers?

[Closing]

In conclusion, Meraki offers a cloud-managed solution that simplifies network management, enhances security, and improves the overall user experience for customers in the Service Provider sector. By addressing their pain points effectively, we believe that Meraki can help service providers differentiate themselves in the market and drive business growth. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to helping you pitch Meraki to your customers.
