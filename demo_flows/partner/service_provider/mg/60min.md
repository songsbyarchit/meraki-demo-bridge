Hey there, partner reseller! Welcome to this demo session focused on the Cisco Meraki MG solution. Today, we'll explore how MG can address the specific needs of the Service Provider sector and help you pitch it effectively to your customers.

To kick things off, let me ask you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Service Provider sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's dive into the demo.

**Use Case 1: Provisioning New Services**
Let's say you have a new customer onboard who needs to quickly provision new services across multiple sites. With **MG's centralized dashboard**, you can easily **click 'Configure > Services'** to set up and deploy services across all sites simultaneously.

**Use Case 2: Troubleshooting Network Issues**
Imagine a scenario where a customer is experiencing network issues at one of their sites. By **clicking 'Monitor > Network Health'** on the Meraki Dashboard, you can quickly identify the root cause of the problem and take necessary actions to resolve it.

**Use Case 3: Managing Bandwidth Usage**
In the Service Provider sector, bandwidth management is crucial. With **MG's traffic shaping feature**, you can **set bandwidth limits** for different applications or users by **clicking 'Configure > Traffic shaping'** on the dashboard.

**Use Case 4: Security Compliance**
Security is a top priority for service providers. With **MG's built-in security features**, such as **firewall rules and content filtering**, you can ensure that your customers' networks are secure and compliant. Simply **navigate to 'Security > Firewall'** on the dashboard to configure these settings.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MG in the Service Provider space:

Q: What are the top service provider pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MG during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

That wraps up our demo session. Thank you for joining, and remember, with Cisco Meraki MG, you can offer your Service Provider customers a reliable, secure, and easy-to-manage networking solution.
