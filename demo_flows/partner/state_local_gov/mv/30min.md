**Demo Script**

Hey there, partner reseller! Today, we're going to talk about Cisco Meraki's MV camera solution and how it can benefit State and Local Government customers. What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

**Use Case 1: Public Safety**
Imagine a scenario where a local government needs to enhance public safety in a high-traffic area. With Meraki MV cameras, they can easily deploy a video surveillance solution that provides real-time monitoring and alerts for any suspicious activity. Let's **navigate to the Meraki Dashboard** and **click 'Cameras > Live View'** to see this in action.

**Use Case 2: Traffic Management**
Another common pain point for State and Local Governments is managing traffic flow efficiently. By using MV cameras with advanced analytics capabilities, they can gather valuable data on traffic patterns, congestion points, and pedestrian behavior. Let's **click 'Cameras > Analytics'** in the Dashboard to explore these insights.

**Use Case 3: Building Security**
Lastly, building security is always a top priority for government facilities. Meraki MV cameras offer high-quality video recording, motion detection, and remote access features that make it easy to monitor and secure government buildings effectively. Let's **click 'Cameras > Motion Alerts'** to see how alerts can be set up for specific areas.

When positioning MV to State and Local Government customers, it's essential to highlight the ease of use and centralized management provided by the Meraki Dashboard. This single pane of glass enables visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management across multiple sites.
