Welcome everyone! Today we're going to dive into a demo of Meraki MR, specifically targeting the State Local Gov sector. As partners, it's essential to understand the pain points our customers in this sector face and how Meraki can help address them. Let's get started!

[Pain Points]

State Local Gov customers often deal with outdated network infrastructure, limited IT resources, and the need for secure and reliable connectivity across multiple locations. They also have strict compliance requirements and the need for easy-to-manage solutions that don't require extensive training.

[Positioning Meraki]

Meraki MR offers a cloud-managed networking solution that is easy to deploy, manage, and scale. With centralized management through the Meraki dashboard, State Local Gov customers can easily monitor and troubleshoot their network from anywhere. The built-in security features, such as integrated firewall and content filtering, help ensure a secure network environment. Plus, the automatic updates and AI-driven insights help optimize network performance without the need for constant manual intervention.

[Use Case 1: Remote Office Connectivity]

Imagine a State Local Gov agency with multiple remote offices spread across a region. With Meraki MR, partners can easily set up secure VPN connections between the main office and remote sites. By **clicking 'Configure > Site-to-Site VPN'** in the dashboard, partners can quickly establish encrypted connections, ensuring data security and seamless communication between locations.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Access]

Another common scenario for State Local Gov customers is the need to provide guest Wi-Fi access in public buildings or community centers. With Meraki MR, partners can set up a separate guest network with customizable splash pages and access controls. By **clicking 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** in the dashboard, partners can easily create a guest network and customize the settings to meet the agency's specific requirements.

[Use Case 3: Traffic Analysis and Optimization]

State Local Gov agencies often struggle with limited bandwidth and the need to prioritize critical applications over less essential traffic. With Meraki MR, partners can use the built-in traffic shaping and application-aware policies to optimize network performance. By **clicking 'Monitor > Traffic Analytics'** in the dashboard, partners can analyze network traffic patterns, identify bandwidth hogs, and prioritize mission-critical applications to ensure a smooth user experience.
