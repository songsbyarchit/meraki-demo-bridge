Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I’m excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's MR product, specifically tailored for our partners in the State And Local Government sector.

Before we dive in, I’d love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, thanks for sharing that. Let's get started with a quick overview of Meraki MR and how it can address these challenges.

First, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard. This is where all the magic happens. With Meraki's single pane of glass dashboard, you can easily manage all your network devices in one place, from access points to switches to security appliances.

Now, let's explore a few use cases that are particularly relevant for State And Local Government:

1. **Remote office connectivity**: With Meraki MR, you can quickly deploy secure wireless access points in remote offices, ensuring seamless connectivity for government employees working from different locations.

2. **BYOD management**: Meraki's built-in security features make it easy to manage and secure devices brought in by employees, contractors, or visitors, helping to maintain compliance with government regulations.

3. **Centralized management**: The Meraki Dashboard allows you to centrally manage multiple sites, making it simple to troubleshoot issues, push out updates, and ensure consistent network performance across all locations.

Let's navigate to the Dashboard now and **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to see an overview of all the access points in our network. From here, we can easily monitor performance, check for any connectivity issues, and make configuration changes as needed.

As a partner selling Meraki MR to State And Local Government customers, you might encounter these common questions:

Q: What are the top state and local government pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

I hope this demo has given you a good sense of how Meraki MR can help address the specific needs of State And Local Government customers. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss specific use cases, feel free to reach out. Thanks for your time!
