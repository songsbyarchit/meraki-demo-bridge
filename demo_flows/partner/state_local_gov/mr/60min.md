Hey there, thanks for joining us today. I'm excited to dive into how Cisco Meraki's MR can address the unique needs of the State And Local Government sector. Before we get started, I'd love to hear from you about the trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions here?

Great, thanks for sharing that with me. Now, let's explore how Meraki MR can make a real impact in the State And Local Government space. 

Use Case 1: **Remote site management**  
Imagine being able to monitor and troubleshoot all your remote sites from one central location. With Meraki's Dashboard, you can easily **navigate to 'Monitor > Overview'** and see the status of all your sites at a glance. No more jumping between different tools or sites to get the information you need.

Use Case 2: **Network segmentation**  
In a sector where security is paramount, network segmentation is crucial. With Meraki, you can **click 'Configure > Addressing & VLANs'** to easily segment your network and control access to different resources. This helps prevent unauthorized access and keeps your network secure.

Use Case 3: **Guest Wi-Fi management**  
State And Local Government facilities often have visitors who need access to Wi-Fi. With Meraki, you can **navigate to 'Wireless > SSIDs'** and set up a separate guest network with just a few clicks. You can also apply policies to ensure guest users don't have access to sensitive data.

Use Case 4: **Application visibility**  
Understanding which applications are running on your network is crucial for managing bandwidth and ensuring critical applications have priority. With Meraki, you can **go to 'Monitor > Application'** to see real-time application usage and performance metrics. This visibility helps you optimize your network for better performance.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MR in the State And Local Government space:

Q: What are the top state and local government pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?  
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready. 

Thank you for joining me on this demo. I hope you now have a better understanding of how Meraki MR can meet the specific needs of State And Local Government customers. Let's continue to explore how we can make a real impact together.
