[Opening]

Hello everyone and welcome to our Meraki SM demo specifically tailored for the State Local Gov sector. Today, we'll be going through some key pain points that customers in this sector care about and how Meraki can help address them. 

[Slide 1 - Introduction to Meraki SM]
Let's start by introducing Meraki SM. Meraki SM is a cloud-based mobile device management solution that allows organizations to easily manage all their devices from a centralized dashboard. This includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even IoT devices. 

[Slide 2 - Pain Points]
Now, let's talk about some pain points that customers in the State Local Gov sector often face. One common pain point is the need to manage a large number of devices across multiple locations. This can be a daunting task without the right tools in place. Another pain point is ensuring the security of sensitive data on these devices, especially in a sector where data privacy and security are top priorities. 

[Slide 3 - How Meraki SM can help]
So, how can Meraki SM help address these pain points? With Meraki SM, organizations can easily enroll devices, manage policies, and push updates from a single dashboard. This not only saves time and resources but also ensures consistency and security across all devices. 

[Use Case 1 - Device Enrollment]
Let's look at a use case. Imagine a State Local Gov agency that needs to enroll a large number of devices for their employees. With Meraki SM, they can simply send out enrollment links to each employee, who can then easily enroll their device with just a few clicks. This simplifies the onboarding process and ensures that all devices are properly managed from the start.

[Use Case 2 - Policy Management]
Another use case is policy management. In a sector where data security is crucial, it's important to have strict policies in place for device usage. With Meraki SM, organizations can easily create and enforce policies such as password requirements, app restrictions, and network access controls.

[Use Case 3 - Remote Wipe]
One more use case is remote wipe. In the event that a device is lost or stolen, organizations need to be able to quickly wipe sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access. With Meraki SM, admins can remotely wipe a device with just a few clicks, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure.
