Hey there! Today, we're going to dive into Cisco Meraki's SM solution and how it can address the specific needs of the State And Local Government sector. Before we get started, I'd love to hear from our partners about the trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's jump into the demo and explore how Meraki can make a real difference for State And Local Government organizations. 

Use Case 1: **Ensuring Network Security**
Let's start by navigating to the Security Center on the Meraki Dashboard. Here, you can see real-time security alerts and take immediate action to protect your network from threats.

Use Case 2: **Managing Multiple Sites**
Next, let's **click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Overview'** to see how the Meraki Dashboard provides a single pane of glass view across all your sites. This unified management makes it easy to troubleshoot and ensure consistency across locations.

Use Case 3: **Improving Network Performance**
Now, let's **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to check the performance of your wireless network. With Meraki, you can easily identify areas of congestion and optimize your network for better user experience.

Use Case 4: **Streamlining Device Management**
Moving on, let's **click 'Systems Manager > Devices'** to see how Meraki simplifies device management. From deploying software updates to enforcing security policies, everything can be done from one central platform.
