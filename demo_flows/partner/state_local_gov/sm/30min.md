Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's SM solution tailored for the State And Local Government sector. Before we dive in, could you share what trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this space?

Great, let's get started. In the State And Local Government sector, one common pain point is the complexity of managing multiple sites with limited resources. With Meraki's centralized dashboard, you can easily oversee all your network operations in one place. Let's take a look at the dashboard now.

**Navigate to the Meraki Dashboard and click 'Monitor > Overview'.**

Another challenge is the lack of visibility into network performance, which can lead to slow troubleshooting. With Meraki, you have real-time insights and alerts to quickly identify and resolve issues. Let's see this in action.

**Click on a specific network device and then click 'Tools > Ping' to test connectivity.**

Lastly, the need for unified management across different locations can be tricky. Meraki simplifies this by offering templates for consistent configurations across sites. Let's explore this feature.

**Click 'Configure > Templates' to view and apply pre-configured settings.**

When positioning SM to State And Local Government customers, remember to emphasize the ease of use with the single dashboard, fast deployment, and built-in security features. Now, let's address some common questions you might encounter:

Q: What are the top state and local government pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining me today. I hope this demo has given you valuable insights into how Meraki's SM solution can address the unique needs of State And Local Government customers. Let me know if you have any further questions!
