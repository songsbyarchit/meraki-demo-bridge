[Opening]

Welcome everyone to our Meraki MX demo focused on the State Local Gov sector. Today, we'll be exploring how Meraki can help address the pain points that customers in this sector care about. Let's dive in.

[Pain Points]

State Local Gov agencies often face challenges with managing multiple locations, ensuring network security, and optimizing limited IT resources. Traditional networking solutions can be complex, costly, and difficult to scale, which can hinder their ability to deliver efficient services to their constituents.

[Meraki Positioning]

Meraki offers a cloud-managed networking solution that is simple to deploy, easy to manage, and provides centralized visibility and control across all locations. With features like zero-touch provisioning, automatic firmware updates, and built-in security, Meraki empowers State Local Gov agencies to streamline their network operations and focus on delivering better services to their communities.

[Use Case 1: Network Security]

Let's look at a use case where a State Local Gov agency needs to ensure the security of their network infrastructure. With Meraki MX, partners can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat Protection'** to set up firewall rules, intrusion prevention, and content filtering to protect against cyber threats. Meraki's integrated security features help agencies safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

[Use Case 2: Remote Connectivity]

Another common pain point for State Local Gov agencies is providing secure remote connectivity for employees working in the field or from home. Partners can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN'** to easily configure VPN tunnels using Meraki MX, ensuring encrypted communication and secure access to internal resources from anywhere. This enables agencies to support remote work initiatives without compromising network security.

[Use Case 3: Traffic Optimization]

Lastly, let's consider a scenario where a State Local Gov agency needs to prioritize network traffic for critical applications such as emergency services or public safety communications. Partners can **click 'SD-WAN & traffic shaping > Traffic shaping'** in the Meraki dashboard to allocate bandwidth and prioritize traffic based on application requirements. This ensures that essential services receive the necessary network resources, improving overall efficiency and user experience.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with attendees, here are two smart questions the presenter can ask:
1. How are you currently managing network security across your agency's multiple locations, and what challenges have you faced in ensuring consistent protection?
2. Can you tell us more about your organization's remote work initiatives and how you are supporting secure connectivity for employees working outside traditional office settings?
