Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo of Cisco Meraki, specifically tailored for our partners in the State And Local Government sector. I'm excited to show you how Meraki can address the unique challenges and pain points faced by customers in this space.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions:
- What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the State And Local Government sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into a few key use cases where Meraki can make a real difference in State And Local Government settings.

Imagine being able to **remotely monitor and troubleshoot network issues** across multiple sites from a single, intuitive dashboard. With Meraki, you can **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to quickly identify and resolve connectivity issues.

Next, picture the **ease of deploying and managing secure guest Wi-Fi networks** in public buildings or facilities. By **clicking 'Wireless > SSIDs'**, you can create separate networks with different access levels for visitors and employees.

Lastly, consider the **need for robust security and compliance** in government networks. Meraki's integrated security features, such as **clicking 'Security > Firewall'** to set up policies, ensure that sensitive data is protected from threats.

Now, let's address a couple of common questions partners might have when positioning Meraki in the State And Local Government space:
- Q: What are the top state and local government pain points this addresses?
  A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

- Q: How do we best position Meraki during the pitch?
  A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

- Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
  A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for exploring Meraki with me today. I hope you can see the value it brings to State And Local Government customers. Let's work together to make their networks more secure, efficient, and manageable.
