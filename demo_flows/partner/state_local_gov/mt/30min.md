[Opening]

Hello and welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a demo of Meraki MT, specifically tailored for the State Local Gov sector. As partners, it's crucial to understand the pain points that our customers care about and how we can position Meraki to address those effectively.

[Pain Points]

When it comes to State Local Gov agencies, one of the biggest pain points they face is the need for secure and reliable network infrastructure. With the increasing amount of sensitive data being shared and stored, it's crucial for them to have a solution that can provide robust security measures without compromising on performance. In addition, these agencies often have limited IT resources and budgets, making it essential for them to find a solution that is easy to manage and cost-effective.

[Use Case 1: Secure Network Access]

Let's start by looking at a common use case for State Local Gov agencies - secure network access for employees and visitors. With Meraki MT, we can easily set up secure access policies to ensure that only authorized users can connect to the network. By **clicking 'Configure > Access control'**, we can create different user profiles and set up rules to control who can access what resources. This not only enhances security but also ensures that the network is optimized for performance.

[Use Case 2: Remote Site Management]

Another use case that is relevant for State Local Gov agencies is remote site management. Many of these agencies have multiple locations spread out across a region, making it challenging to manage their network infrastructure efficiently. With Meraki MT, we can easily monitor and manage all remote sites from a centralized dashboard. By **clicking 'Monitor > Sites'**, we can see an overview of all sites and quickly identify any issues that need attention. This centralized management approach not only saves time but also improves the overall network reliability.

[Use Case 3: Disaster Recovery]

Lastly, let's talk about disaster recovery. State Local Gov agencies need to be prepared for any unexpected events that could disrupt their network operations. With Meraki MT, we can set up automated backup and recovery processes to ensure that critical network configurations are always protected. By **clicking 'Configure > Backup & Restore'**, we can schedule regular backups and easily restore configurations in case of any issues. This proactive approach to disaster recovery can help agencies minimize downtime and ensure continuity of operations.

[Smart Questions]

As we wrap up this demo, here are a few smart questions that you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing your network security policies, and what challenges are you facing in this area?
2. How do you currently monitor and manage your remote sites, and what improvements would you like to see in this process?
3. What measures do you have in place for disaster recovery, and how confident are you in your current approach?
