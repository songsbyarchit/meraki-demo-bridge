Hey there, I'm glad to be speaking with you today. As a partner in the tech industry, you're likely aware of the challenges and trends that customers in the State And Local Government sector are facing. What have you been noticing lately? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Today, we're diving into a demo of Cisco Meraki's MS product, tailored specifically for the State And Local Government sector. Let's explore how Meraki can address the pain points faced by organizations in this sector.

Imagine a scenario where a state government office is struggling with network visibility across multiple locations. With Meraki's Dashboard, **click 'Monitor > Clients'**, they can easily see all connected devices in real-time, allowing for quick troubleshooting and ensuring smooth operations.

Another common use case is a local government agency dealing with complex network setups in various departments. By leveraging **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** on the Meraki Dashboard, IT admins can streamline network management and ensure consistent configurations across all sites.

Lastly, picture a situation where a city's public safety department needs to ensure secure and reliable network connectivity for their critical operations. Meraki's built-in security features and **click 'Security > Firewall'** capabilities provide peace of mind and protection against potential threats.

When pitching Meraki's MS to State And Local Government customers, you may encounter questions like:
Q: What are the top state and local government pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MS during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
