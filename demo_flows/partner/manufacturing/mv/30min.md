Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I know you're a partner in the manufacturing sector, and we're here to talk about the Cisco Meraki MV solution. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's get started. In manufacturing, one of the biggest pain points is the need for reliable and secure video surveillance. With Cisco Meraki MV, we can address this need by providing a cloud-managed solution that offers seamless integration with the Meraki Dashboard. This allows for easy deployment, centralized management, and enhanced visibility across multiple sites.

Let's look at a specific use case. Imagine a manufacturing facility with multiple buildings spread out over a large area. With Meraki MV, you can easily set up cameras in each building and monitor them all from the same dashboard. This simplifies troubleshooting and ensures that security is consistent across the entire facility.

Now, let's **click 'Cameras > Live'** on the dashboard to see real-time footage from a camera in one of the buildings. This level of visibility is crucial in the manufacturing sector, where quick decision-making and incident response are essential.

Another use case for Meraki MV is in monitoring production lines. By strategically placing cameras along the line, manufacturers can identify bottlenecks, improve efficiency, and ensure quality control. With the Meraki Dashboard, they can easily access historical footage and analytics to make data-driven decisions.

**Click 'Cameras > Analytics'** on the dashboard to see the insights and trends that can be derived from the camera footage. This kind of information is invaluable in optimizing production processes and improving overall performance.

When pitching Meraki MV to customers in the manufacturing sector, here are a few key questions you might encounter:

Q: What are the top manufacturing pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MV during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining me today, and I hope this demo has given you a better understanding of how Meraki MV can benefit manufacturing customers. If you have any more questions or would like to dive deeper into any specific features, feel free to reach out.
