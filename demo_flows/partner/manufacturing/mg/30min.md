Hello and welcome to our Meraki MG demo tailored for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we'll be focusing on how Meraki can help address common pain points in this industry and provide solutions to improve network connectivity and security.

First, let's discuss some pain points that customers in the Manufacturing sector typically face. These include the need for reliable and secure network connectivity across multiple locations, the challenge of managing and monitoring a large number of devices, and the importance of ensuring uptime for critical operations.

So, how can Meraki help address these pain points? Let's dive into a few use cases that demonstrate the capabilities of the Meraki MG.

Use Case 1: Remote Monitoring and Troubleshooting
Imagine a scenario where a manufacturing plant experiences a network outage. With Meraki MG, partners can remotely access the network dashboard to identify the issue quickly. By **clicking 'Tools > Live Tools'**, they can troubleshoot connectivity problems in real-time, minimizing downtime and keeping operations running smoothly.

Use Case 2: Secure Network Segmentation
In a manufacturing environment, it's crucial to separate different types of devices to ensure security and compliance. Partners can easily create secure network segments using Meraki MG by **clicking 'Configure > VLANs'**. This allows for granular control over network traffic and helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Use Case 3: Quality of Service (QoS) for Voice and Video Applications
Many manufacturing facilities rely on voice and video communications for efficient operations. With Meraki MG, partners can prioritize traffic for these applications by **clicking 'Configure > Traffic Shaping'**. This ensures a seamless user experience and consistent performance for critical business processes.

Now, let's wrap up with a few smart questions that partners can use to prompt discussion with potential customers:

1. How are you currently managing network connectivity across your manufacturing sites? Are there any pain points you are experiencing in this area?
2. What measures do you have in place to ensure the security of your network and devices in your manufacturing environment?
3. How important is reliable and high-quality network performance for your day-to-day operations, and what challenges have you faced in achieving this?
