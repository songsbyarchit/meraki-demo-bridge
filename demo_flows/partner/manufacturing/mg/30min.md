Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo on Cisco Meraki's MG for the Manufacturing sector.

Let's dive right in with a quick warm-up question: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Manufacturing sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's explore how Meraki can address these challenges with a focus on the Manufacturing sector.

**Use Case 1: Remote Monitoring and Troubleshooting**
Imagine a scenario where you have multiple manufacturing facilities spread out across different locations. With Meraki's centralized dashboard, you can quickly **navigate to 'Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time data on all connected devices and easily troubleshoot any issues remotely.

**Use Case 2: Secure Access Control**
In a manufacturing environment, security is paramount. With Meraki, you can **click 'Configure > Wireless > Access Control'** to set up granular access policies, ensuring only authorized devices can connect to your network.

**Use Case 3: Scalability and Expansion**
As your manufacturing business grows, so does your network. With Meraki, adding new sites or expanding existing ones is a breeze. Simply **go to 'Organization > Inventory'** to see all your network devices and easily manage them from a single pane of glass.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching MG in the Manufacturing space:

Q: What are the top manufacturing pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MG during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

That's all for today's demo. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to helping you empower your manufacturing customers with Cisco Meraki's MG solution.
