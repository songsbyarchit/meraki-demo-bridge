Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo. I know you're a partner in the Manufacturing sector, so I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MT can help address some of the challenges you might be facing. Before we dive in, can you share with me any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's get started. One common pain point in Manufacturing is the need for visibility and simplified troubleshooting across multiple sites. With Meraki's single dashboard, you can easily manage all your network devices in one place. Let's take a look at a few specific use cases to see how this can benefit you:

1. **Monitor production line performance in real-time**
2. **Track inventory movement with location analytics**
3. **Secure sensitive data with network segmentation**
4. **Automate guest Wi-Fi access for visitors**

Now, let's dive into the Meraki Dashboard and see how it can help you achieve these use cases.

**click 'Monitor > Production Line' to view real-time performance metrics**
**navigate to 'Analytics > Location' to track inventory movement**
**configure network segmentation by clicking 'Security > Firewall rules'**
**set up guest Wi-Fi access by clicking 'Wireless > Access Control'**

When positioning MT in the Manufacturing space, partners often ask about the top pain points this solution addresses. Usually, it's lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites. To best position MT during the pitch, emphasize Merakiâ€™s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security. As for installation or deployment concerns, it's typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

I hope this demo has given you a good overview of how Cisco Meraki can help meet the unique needs of the Manufacturing sector. Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to see in action.
