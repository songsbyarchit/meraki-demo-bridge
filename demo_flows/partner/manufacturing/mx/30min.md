[Opening]

Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MX demo, specifically tailored for the Manufacturing sector. As partners, we understand the unique challenges that manufacturing businesses face and how important it is to have a secure and reliable network infrastructure in place. Today, we will be showcasing how Meraki MX can address these pain points and help you pitch to your manufacturing customers effectively.

[Pain Points]

One of the key pain points in the manufacturing industry is the need for a robust and secure network infrastructure. With the rise of Industry 4.0 and the increasing use of IoT devices, manufacturers need a solution that can handle the high volume of data traffic while ensuring the security of their sensitive information. Additionally, downtime in production can be extremely costly for manufacturers, so having a network that is reliable and easy to manage is crucial.

[Use Case 1: Secure Remote Access]

Let's dive into our first use case - secure remote access. Many manufacturing businesses have employees who need to access the network remotely, whether they are working from home or on the go. With Meraki MX, you can easily set up VPNs for secure remote access, ensuring that your employees can connect to the network securely from anywhere. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'** to see how simple it is to configure.

[Use Case 2: Network Segmentation]

Our second use case is network segmentation. In manufacturing environments, it's important to segment the network to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive production data. With Meraki MX, you can easily create VLANs and firewall rules to segment your network and control access to different parts of the network. **Click 'Configure > Addressing & VLANs'** to set up VLANs and firewall rules.

[Use Case 3: Traffic Analytics]

Lastly, let's talk about traffic analytics. Understanding how your network is being used is crucial for optimizing performance and identifying potential security threats. With Meraki MX, you can easily view detailed traffic analytics to see which applications are consuming the most bandwidth and where potential bottlenecks may occur. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Traffic analytics'** to explore this feature.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with your manufacturing customers, here are two smart questions you can ask:
1. How do you currently handle remote access for your employees, and have you experienced any security challenges with this setup?
2. Can you share any instances where network downtime has impacted your production process, and how quickly were you able to resolve the issue?

Thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MX demo. We hope that you now have a better understanding of how Meraki MX can address the pain points of manufacturing businesses and help you pitch to your customers effectively.
