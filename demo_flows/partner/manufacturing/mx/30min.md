Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo. I know you're a partner in the manufacturing sector, so I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MX can help address some of the challenges you might be facing with your customers. Before we dive in, could you share with me what trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in the manufacturing sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's get started. One common pain point in manufacturing is the need for secure and reliable networking across multiple sites. With Meraki MX, you can easily manage all your sites from a single dashboard. **Let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard now.**
