[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MX demo tailored for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we'll be showcasing how Meraki can help address key pain points in this industry and provide solutions to improve network security, visibility, and management.

[Slide 1: Introduction to Meraki MX]
Let's start with a brief overview of Meraki MX. The Meraki MX is a comprehensive security and SD-WAN solution that simplifies network management, provides advanced security features, and ensures high performance for your manufacturing environment.

[Slide 2: Pain Points in Manufacturing]
Manufacturers often face challenges such as network downtime, security threats, and lack of visibility into their network infrastructure. These issues can lead to disruptions in production, loss of sensitive data, and inefficiencies in operations.

[Use Case 1: Secure Remote Access]
One of the key use cases for Meraki MX in the manufacturing sector is secure remote access for employees and contractors. With Meraki's easy-to-configure VPN features, you can ensure secure connectivity for remote workers accessing critical systems and data.

**Demo: Show how to set up a VPN tunnel for remote access by clicking 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN > Add a VPN connection'.**

[Use Case 2: Network Segmentation]
Another important use case is network segmentation to isolate operational technology (OT) devices from the corporate network. By creating separate VLANs for production equipment, you can prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of cyberattacks targeting manufacturing systems.

**Demo: Demonstrate how to create VLANs for network segmentation by clicking 'Configure > Addressing & VLANs'.**

[Use Case 3: Application-Aware Traffic Shaping]
Meraki MX allows you to prioritize mission-critical applications over non-essential traffic, ensuring optimal performance for critical manufacturing processes. With application-aware traffic shaping, you can allocate bandwidth based on the specific needs of your production applications.

**Demo: Show how to configure traffic shaping rules by clicking 'Security & SD-WAN > SD-WAN & traffic shaping'.**

[Use Case 4: Threat Intelligence Integration]
Meraki MX integrates with Cisco's threat intelligence feeds to provide real-time protection against emerging threats. By leveraging threat intelligence data, you can proactively defend your manufacturing network against malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats.

**Demo: Illustrate how to enable threat intelligence integration by clicking 'Security & SD-WAN > Security services'.**

[Closing]

In conclusion, Meraki MX offers a comprehensive solution for addressing the unique challenges faced by manufacturers, including network security, visibility, and performance. By leveraging Meraki's features, you can enhance the security and efficiency of your manufacturing operations.
