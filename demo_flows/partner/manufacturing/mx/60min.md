Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I know you're a partner in the manufacturing sector, so I thought we could dive into how Cisco Meraki's MX can help your customers. What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's jump into the demo now. Imagine you're working with a manufacturing customer who is struggling with network visibility and management across multiple sites. With Meraki MX, we can help them address these pain points and streamline their operations. 

**Use Case 1: Centralized Network Management**
Let's start by **logging into the Meraki Dashboard**. Here, you can see all the MX devices across your customer's various manufacturing facilities in a single pane of glass. This centralized view allows for easy monitoring and management, saving time and reducing complexity.

**Use Case 2: Secure Site-to-Site Connectivity**
Next, let's **navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-Site VPN'**. With Meraki MX, your customer can easily set up secure VPN connections between their different manufacturing sites, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

**Use Case 3: Application-Based Traffic Shaping**
Now, let's **click 'SD-WAN & Traffic Shaping'**. Meraki MX enables your customer to prioritize critical applications over less important ones, optimizing network performance and ensuring smooth operations on the manufacturing floor.

**Use Case 4: Automated Firmware Updates**
Moving on to **'Security & SD-WAN > Appliance Upgrades'**, Meraki MX simplifies the process of updating firmware across all devices, reducing downtime and enhancing security for your customer's network.

**Use Case 5: Network Segmentation**
Let's explore **'Addressing & VLANs'**. With Meraki MX, your customer can easily segment their network to isolate sensitive data or devices, enhancing security and compliance within their manufacturing environment.

**Use Case 6: Real-Time Troubleshooting**
Lastly, let's **check out the 'Live Tools' section**. Here, your customer can troubleshoot network issues in real-time, pinpointing and resolving issues quickly to minimize downtime and keep operations running smoothly.

When pitching MX in the Manufacturing space, partners often ask:
Q: What are the top manufacturing pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MX during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready. 

That's a wrap for today's demo. I hope you found it helpful and are excited to help your manufacturing customers with Meraki MX. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance. Thanks for tuning in!
