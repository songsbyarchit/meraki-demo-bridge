[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki SM demo tailored for the Manufacturing sector. I know many of you are partners looking to pitch Meraki to customers in this industry, so today we're going to cover some key pain points that manufacturing customers care about and how Meraki can address them.

[Pain Points]

Let's start with some common pain points in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers often struggle with managing a large number of devices across multiple locations, ensuring network security and compliance, and maintaining uptime for critical operations. Traditional solutions can be complex, expensive, and time-consuming to manage.

[Positioning Meraki]

This is where Meraki comes in. With our cloud-managed solution, partners can offer manufacturing customers a simple, centralized way to manage all their devices from a single dashboard. This not only simplifies network management but also improves security and compliance with built-in features like automated patching and network segmentation.

[Use Case 1: Device Management]

One key use case for manufacturing customers is device management. With Meraki SM, partners can easily onboard new devices, push software updates, and troubleshoot issues remotely. **Let me show you how simple it is to onboard a new device. Just click 'Systems Manager > Add Devices' and follow the prompts to enroll a new device.**

[Use Case 2: Network Security]

Another critical use case is network security. Manufacturing customers need to protect their sensitive data and ensure compliance with industry regulations. With Meraki, partners can set up role-based access control, monitor device compliance, and enforce security policies across all devices. **To configure security policies, just click 'Systems Manager > Security Policies' and set your desired rules.**

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]

Lastly, remote troubleshooting is essential for manufacturing customers who may have devices spread across multiple locations. With Meraki SM, partners can remotely diagnose and fix issues without the need for on-site visits, saving time and reducing downtime. **To troubleshoot a device, click 'Systems Manager > Device List' and select the device you want to troubleshoot.**

[Discussion Questions]

Now that we've covered some key use cases, here are a few smart questions you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently manage and secure your devices across multiple locations?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face when it comes to network security and compliance?
3. How much time and resources are currently spent on troubleshooting and maintaining your devices?

[Closing]

I hope this demo has given you a better understanding of how Meraki can address the pain points of manufacturing customers. Remember, with Meraki SM, partners can offer a simple, secure, and centralized solution that meets the unique needs of the manufacturing sector.
