I know you're a partner reseller, so I'm excited to dive into how Cisco Meraki's MR can help address the unique challenges faced by customers in the Manufacturing sector. Before we get started, could you share what trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this space?

Great, let's begin by looking at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for visibility and management. **Click 'Dashboard'** to see how easy it is to navigate and monitor your network in real-time.

Now, let's explore a specific use case in Manufacturing. Imagine a factory with multiple buildings. With Meraki MR, you can easily manage all the access points across different sites from one dashboard. **Click 'Wireless > Access points'** to see how simple it is to configure and troubleshoot.

Another pain point in Manufacturing is ensuring secure connections for IoT devices. Meraki MR offers advanced security features like integrated firewall and deep packet inspection to protect your network. **Click 'Security > Firewall & traffic shaping'** to see how you can set up policies to secure your IoT devices.
