[Opening]

Hello, and thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MR demo focused on the Manufacturing sector. Today, we will be discussing how Meraki can help address the pain points that manufacturing customers care about. As a partner, it is crucial to understand these pain points and position Meraki as the solution to their challenges.

[Pain Points]

Manufacturing customers often face challenges such as maintaining a reliable and secure network across their facilities, ensuring seamless connectivity for their IoT devices, and managing multiple sites efficiently. These pain points can lead to downtime, security breaches, and inefficiencies in their operations.

[Use Case 1: Network Management]

Let's explore a use case where a manufacturing customer has multiple sites that need to be managed centrally. With Meraki's cloud-managed networking solution, partners can **login to the Meraki dashboard** and easily configure, monitor, and troubleshoot all their customer's sites from one centralized location. This not only saves time and resources but also ensures consistent network performance across all sites.

[Use Case 2: IoT Device Connectivity]

Another common pain point for manufacturing customers is ensuring seamless connectivity for their IoT devices. With Meraki MR access points, partners can **click 'Configure > Wireless settings'** and easily set up a dedicated IoT network that prioritizes IoT traffic and ensures reliable connectivity for these devices. This helps improve operational efficiency and productivity in the manufacturing environment.

[Use Case 3: Security]

Security is always a top concern for manufacturing customers, especially with the rise of cyber threats targeting industrial networks. With Meraki's built-in security features such as integrated firewall, intrusion prevention, and content filtering, partners can **navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** and easily configure robust security policies to protect their customer's network from cyber threats. This not only provides peace of mind for the customer but also helps maintain compliance with industry regulations.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with the attendees, here are two smart questions that the presenter can ask:

1. How are you currently managing network security across your manufacturing facilities?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face when it comes to connecting and managing IoT devices in your manufacturing environment?

[Closing]

In conclusion, Meraki MR offers a comprehensive solution for addressing the pain points that manufacturing customers care about. By understanding these pain points and positioning Meraki as the answer, partners can effectively pitch Meraki to their customers and help them overcome their network challenges. Thank you for attending this demo, and we look forward to helping you succeed with Meraki in the Manufacturing sector.
