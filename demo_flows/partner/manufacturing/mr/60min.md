Hey there! Today, we're going to dive into how Cisco Meraki MR can revolutionize the networking experience for manufacturing companies. I know you're a partner reseller, so I'm curious, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's kick things off with a use case that's common in manufacturing: ensuring seamless connectivity across multiple production sites. With **MR**, you can easily **navigate to 'Wireless > Monitor > Access Points'** on the Meraki Dashboard to oversee the network performance at each location. This visibility allows for proactive troubleshooting and ensures minimal downtime.

Another pain point in manufacturing is the need for secure guest access. By **clicking 'Wireless > Configure > Access Control'** on the dashboard, you can quickly set up a customized guest network with unique login credentials. This not only enhances security but also streamlines the onboarding process for visitors.

Next, let's address the challenge of managing a vast array of IoT devices on the network. With **MR's** integrated IoT capabilities, you can **easily configure 'Wireless > Configure > Wireless Networks'** to prioritize traffic for these devices. This ensures that critical machinery and sensors receive the bandwidth they require for optimal performance.

Moving on, let's talk about the importance of real-time location tracking in a manufacturing environment. By **navigating to 'Wireless > Location Analytics'** on the Meraki Dashboard, you can monitor the movement of assets and personnel within the facility. This data can be invaluable for optimizing workflows and ensuring employee safety.

As we wrap up, let's address a common question partners have when positioning MR in the manufacturing sector:

Q: What are the top manufacturing pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
