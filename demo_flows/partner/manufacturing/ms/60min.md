Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo on Cisco Meraki's MS series, tailored specifically for the Manufacturing sector. As a partner, I know you're always looking for ways to address the unique challenges your customers face in this industry. So, what trends or challenges have you been seeing with customers in Manufacturing lately? And what do you find most unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's dive into the demo now. Imagine you're talking to a manufacturing customer who is struggling with network visibility and management across multiple sites. With Cisco Meraki's MS series, you can offer them a solution that provides a single pane of glass for all their networking needs. **Click 'Dashboard'** to see how easy it is to navigate and manage everything from one central platform.

One of the biggest pain points in Manufacturing is downtime due to network issues. With Meraki MS, you can quickly identify and troubleshoot any problems that arise. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time data on all devices connected to the network.

Another common challenge in Manufacturing is maintaining security across different locations. With Meraki, you can easily apply consistent security policies across all sites. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to set up firewall rules that apply universally.

For companies with a global presence, managing networks across different regions can be a headache. Meraki's templates feature allows you to configure settings once and apply them to multiple sites. **Click 'Switch > Configure > Templates'** to see how easy it is to streamline network management.

Customers in Manufacturing often struggle with the complexity of managing IoT devices on their network. With Meraki, you can easily segment and prioritize traffic for these devices. **Click 'Switch > Settings > Traffic Shaping'** to ensure critical devices get the bandwidth they need.
