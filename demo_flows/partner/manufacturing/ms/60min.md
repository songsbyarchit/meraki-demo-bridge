[Opening]

Welcome everyone to today's Meraki MS demo, specifically tailored for the Manufacturing sector. Today, we will be showcasing how Meraki can address the pain points that manufacturing customers care about and how you as partners can position Meraki as the solution of choice.

[Pain Points]

Manufacturing customers often face challenges with maintaining network reliability and security, managing a large number of devices and users across multiple sites, and ensuring efficient communication and collaboration within their organization. These pain points can lead to downtime, inefficiencies, and potential security breaches.

[Use Case 1: Network Reliability]

Let's start with the first use case - ensuring network reliability. With Meraki MS, partners can offer customers a centralized dashboard to easily monitor and manage their network infrastructure. By **click 'Network > Switches'**, partners can quickly identify any issues, troubleshoot, and ensure maximum uptime for critical manufacturing operations.

[Use Case 2: Device Management]

Next, let's talk about device management. Manufacturing customers often have a large number of devices connected to their network. With Meraki MS, partners can **click 'Clients'** to see a comprehensive list of connected devices, monitor their activity, and easily enforce security policies to protect against unauthorized access.

[Use Case 3: Site-to-Site Communication]

Another key pain point for manufacturing customers is ensuring efficient communication and collaboration across multiple sites. With Meraki MS, partners can **click 'Configure > Site-to-Site VPN'** to set up secure connections between different manufacturing facilities, allowing for seamless data transfer and collaboration between teams.

[Use Case 4: Security]

Security is a top priority for manufacturing customers, especially when dealing with sensitive data and intellectual property. With Meraki MS, partners can **click 'Security > Access Control'** to easily configure role-based access control policies, monitor network activity in real-time, and detect and respond to any security threats quickly and effectively.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with attendees, here are two smart questions you can ask:

1. How are you currently managing network reliability and security across your manufacturing sites?
2. What challenges have you faced with device management and ensuring efficient communication within your organization?

[Closing]

In conclusion, by showcasing these use cases and addressing the pain points that manufacturing customers care about, partners can position Meraki as the ideal solution for their networking needs. Thank you for joining today's demo, and we look forward to helping you pitch Meraki to your manufacturing customers.
