[Opening]

Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MS demo. Today, we will be targeting the Professional Services sector and focusing on how Meraki can help partners like yourself pitch to customers effectively.

Let's start by discussing some pain points that customers in the Professional Services sector care about. These customers often face challenges with network management, security, and scalability. They need a solution that is easy to deploy, manage, and secure, all while being able to scale as their business grows.

[Use Case 1: Easy Deployment]

Let's start with the first use case: Easy Deployment. One of the key features of Meraki MS is its plug-and-play deployment. With Meraki, partners can easily deploy switches by simply plugging them in and using the cloud-based dashboard to configure and monitor them. **click 'Configure > Switch ports'**

[Use Case 2: Network Security]

Moving on to our second use case: Network Security. Customers in the Professional Services sector are concerned about network security, and Meraki MS offers advanced security features such as access control, layer 3 routing, and integrated firewall capabilities. Partners can assure their customers that their networks are secure with Meraki MS.

[Use Case 3: Centralized Management]

Our third use case is Centralized Management. Professional Services customers often have multiple locations that need to be managed centrally. With Meraki MS, partners can easily manage all their customers' networks from a single dashboard, making it simple to monitor and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

[Use Case 4: Scalability]

Next, let's talk about Scalability. As customers in the Professional Services sector grow, they need a network solution that can scale with them. Meraki MS offers a scalable solution that can easily accommodate new users, devices, and locations without the need for complex configurations.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with your customers, here are two smart questions you can ask:

1. How important is network security to your organization, and what measures do you currently have in place to protect your network?
2. How do you currently manage your network across multiple locations, and what challenges have you faced in doing so?
