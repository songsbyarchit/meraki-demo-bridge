[Opening]

Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MS demo tailored for the Professional Services sector. Today, we're going to walk through some key features and use cases that can help you pitch Meraki to your customers in this industry.

[Pain Points]

Let's start by discussing some pain points that customers in the Professional Services sector typically face. One common pain point is the need for a reliable and secure network infrastructure that can support their business operations. Many companies in this sector have multiple locations and need a centralized solution to manage their network efficiently.

Another pain point is the need for visibility and control over their network. Customers want to be able to easily monitor network performance, troubleshoot issues, and make changes quickly and easily.

[Positioning]

This is where Meraki comes in. Meraki offers a cloud-managed network solution that provides centralized management, visibility, and control over the entire network. With Meraki, customers can easily deploy and manage their network infrastructure from a single dashboard, saving time and resources.

[Use Case 1: Centralized Management]

One use case that is particularly relevant to the Professional Services sector is the ability to centrally manage multiple locations. With Meraki, partners can easily **click 'Organizations > Inventory'** to see all their network devices across different locations and make changes to configurations, policies, and settings from one centralized dashboard.

[Use Case 2: Network Visibility]

Another use case that customers in this sector care about is network visibility. With Meraki, partners can **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time information about all devices connected to the network, including device type, usage, and location. This visibility helps customers identify and troubleshoot issues quickly, improving overall network performance.

[Use Case 3: Secure Access Control]

Lastly, secure access control is essential for customers in the Professional Services sector. With Meraki, partners can easily **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to set up access control policies based on user roles, device types, and location. This helps customers ensure that only authorized devices and users have access to their network, reducing the risk of security breaches.

[Smart Questions]

Now, let's end with a few smart questions that you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently manage your network across multiple locations? Are you looking for a more centralized solution?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face in terms of network visibility and control? How could a solution like Meraki help address these challenges?
3. How important is network security to your organization, and what measures do you currently have in place to protect your network?
