What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's jump right in and explore how Meraki can address the pain points your customers care about. 

First off, let's talk about the Meraki Dashboard. This platform is the heart of the Meraki experience, offering a single pane of glass for visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management. 

**UI Interaction 1: Click 'Dashboard' tab to access the main view**  
**UI Interaction 2: Navigate to 'Monitor > Clients' to check connected devices**  
**UI Interaction 3: Click 'Switch ports' under 'Configure' to manage port settings**

Now, let's look at a couple of use cases in the Professional Services sector where Meraki MS shines:

1. **Use Case 1: Multi-site Management**  
   Imagine managing multiple office locations from a centralized dashboard. With Meraki, you can quickly deploy and configure switches across different sites, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

2. **Use Case 2: Troubleshooting Made Easy**  
   When issues arise, the Meraki Dashboard provides real-time insights into network performance, allowing you to pinpoint and resolve issues faster than ever before.

What are the top professional services pain points this addresses?  
Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

How do we best position MS during the pitch?  
Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
