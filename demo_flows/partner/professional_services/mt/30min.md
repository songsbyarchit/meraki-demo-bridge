[Opening]

Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this demo of Meraki MT targeting the Professional Services sector. I'm excited to show you how Meraki can help you pitch to your customers and address their pain points effectively. 

[Slide 1: Pain Points]

Presenter: Let's start by discussing the pain points that customers in the Professional Services sector care about. Most of your clients are likely looking for a networking solution that is easy to manage, secure, and scalable. They want a solution that allows them to focus on their core business without worrying about network infrastructure.

[Slide 2: Meraki Positioning]

Presenter: This is where Meraki comes in. Meraki offers a cloud-managed networking solution that is intuitive, secure, and scalable. With Meraki, your customers can easily manage their network from anywhere, ensure security with built-in security features, and scale their network as their business grows.

[Use Case 1: Remote Office Setup]

Presenter: Let's look at a use case. Imagine one of your customers in the Professional Services sector is setting up a remote office. With Meraki, they can easily deploy and manage network devices remotely through the cloud dashboard. They can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to set up VLANs, QoS, and security policies without needing to be on-site.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Access]

Presenter: Another common use case for Professional Services firms is providing guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki, your clients can easily set up a separate guest network with limited access and bandwidth controls. They can **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a new SSID for guests and **click 'Access Control'** to set up authentication requirements.

[Closing]

Presenter: To wrap up, I want to leave you with a few smart questions you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently manage your network infrastructure, and what pain points are you experiencing?
2. Are you looking to expand your network in the future, and how important is scalability to your business?
3. What security measures do you currently have in place, and how do you ensure the security of your network?

Remember, with Meraki, you can offer your customers a solution that is easy to manage, secure, and scalable. Thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to helping you pitch Meraki to your clients in the Professional Services sector.
