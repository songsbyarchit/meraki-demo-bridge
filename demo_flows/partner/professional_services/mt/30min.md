Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki targeted towards the Professional Services sector.

Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you:
- What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's start by looking at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for network management. **Click 'Dashboard'** to access it.

One key pain point in the Professional Services sector is the need for visibility and control over multiple sites. With Meraki, you can easily monitor and manage all your locations from a single pane of glass.

Let's take a look at a use case: a professional services firm with multiple branch offices. **Click 'Network-wide > Sites'** to see all the locations on the dashboard.

Another common challenge is troubleshooting network issues quickly. With Meraki, you can easily identify and resolve issues through real-time monitoring and alerts.

Let's navigate to the troubleshooting section. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see a list of connected devices and their status.

Lastly, managing a complex network infrastructure can be daunting. Meraki simplifies this by offering unified management for all your networking devices.

Let's explore network configuration. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to set up and manage switch ports easily.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning Meraki in the Professional Services space:

Q: What are the top professional services pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MT during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for taking the time to explore Meraki with me today. If you have any further questions or need additional information, feel free to reach out.
