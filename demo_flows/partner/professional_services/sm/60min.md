[Slide 1: Introduction to Meraki SM]
Let's start by talking about the pain points that Professional Services companies face when it comes to network management. These companies often have multiple offices across different locations, making it challenging to ensure consistent network security and performance. With Meraki SM, you can centrally manage all your network devices, from switches to access points, through a single, intuitive dashboard.

[Slide 3: Use Case 2 - Security Compliance]
Professional Services companies deal with sensitive client data, so network security is a top priority. Meraki SM allows you to set up firewall rules, VPNs, and content filtering policies to ensure compliance with industry regulations. **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to configure custom rules for your network.
