Hey there, thanks for joining me today. I know you're a partner in the professional services sector, and we're here to discuss how Cisco Meraki's SM solution can help you pitch to customers in this space.

So, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the professional services sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's dive into the demo now.

**Use Case 1: Network Visibility**
Let's start by **logging into the Meraki Dashboard**. As you can see, the dashboard provides a single pane of glass view of your entire network, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot any issues.

**Use Case 2: Simplified Troubleshooting**
Now, let's **click on 'Wireless > Access Points'**. From here, you can quickly identify any connectivity issues or performance bottlenecks and take action to resolve them.

**Use Case 3: Unified Management**
Next, **navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Appliance Status'**. Here, you can see all your security appliances in one place, allowing for seamless management and policy enforcement across multiple sites.

**Use Case 4: Remote Site Deployment**
Let's **go to 'Organization > Inventory'**. From here, you can easily deploy and manage new devices at remote sites, saving time and ensuring consistency across your network.

**Use Case 5: Application Visibility**
Now, let's **click on 'Monitor > Application'**. This feature allows you to see which applications are consuming the most bandwidth, helping you optimize network performance and prioritize critical applications.

**Use Case 6: Compliance Monitoring**
Lastly, let's **navigate to 'Switch > Switch Ports'**. Here, you can ensure that all devices on your network are compliant with security policies and regulations, minimizing the risk of data breaches.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have:

Q: What are the top professional services pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
