[Opening]

Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MG demo targeting the Professional Services sector. As partners, you play a crucial role in helping customers find the right solutions for their networking needs. Today, we'll be focusing on the Meraki MG and how it can address common pain points in this industry.

[Pain Points]

Presenter: In the Professional Services sector, customers often face challenges with managing a large number of remote sites, ensuring reliable connectivity for their teams, and maintaining security across their network. These pain points can lead to downtime, loss of productivity, and security breaches. With the Meraki MG, we can help address these challenges and provide a seamless networking experience for your customers.

[Use Case 1: Remote Site Management]

Presenter: One use case for the Meraki MG is remote site management. With the centralized dashboard, partners can easily monitor and manage all their customers' remote sites from one location. **Click 'Dashboard > Manage > Devices'**. This simplifies network management and reduces the need for onsite visits, saving time and resources for both partners and customers.

[Use Case 2: Reliable Connectivity]

Presenter: Another use case is ensuring reliable connectivity for teams working remotely or in the field. The Meraki MG offers built-in 4G LTE failover, so even if the primary connection goes down, users can seamlessly switch to the cellular network without any interruptions. This ensures business continuity and keeps teams productive no matter where they are located.

[Use Case 3: Security]

Presenter: Security is always a top concern for customers in the Professional Services sector. With the Meraki MG, partners can easily set up VPN tunnels to secure communication between remote sites and headquarters. **Click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'**. This helps protect sensitive data and ensures that confidential information stays secure.

[Use Case 4: Scalability]

Presenter: Lastly, scalability is key for customers with growing networks. The Meraki MG is designed to scale effortlessly as the network expands. Partners can easily add new devices, sites, and users to the network without any disruptions. This flexibility allows customers to adapt to changing business needs without any hassle.

[Discussion Questions]

Presenter: Now, before we wrap up, I'd like to ask a couple of questions to prompt some discussion. How do your customers currently manage their remote sites, and what challenges do they face in ensuring reliable connectivity for their teams? How important is network security to your customers, and what measures do they currently have in place to protect their data?
