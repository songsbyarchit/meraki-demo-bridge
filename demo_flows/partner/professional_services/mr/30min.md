Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's MR solution, specifically tailored for the Professional Services sector. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you about any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions here?

Now, let's take a look at how Meraki MR can address the pain points faced by Professional Services organizations. One common issue is the lack of visibility and control over network infrastructure. With Meraki's Dashboard as the central platform, you can easily monitor and manage all your sites from a single pane of glass. Let's **click 'Monitor > Overview'** to see this in action.

Another challenge is the complexity of managing multiple sites, each with its own networking needs. Meraki simplifies this with templates that can be applied across locations, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment. Let's **click 'Configure > Templates'** to explore this feature further.

For Professional Services firms that prioritize fast and efficient troubleshooting, Meraki's cloud-managed architecture enables remote diagnostics and troubleshooting, reducing downtime and increasing productivity. Let's **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time client data and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

When positioning Meraki MR to customers in the Professional Services sector, it's important to highlight the ease of use, single dashboard for unified management, and fast deployment with built-in security features. Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching MR in this space:

Q: What are the top professional services pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

I hope this demo has given you a clear understanding of how Meraki MR can help Professional Services organizations overcome their network challenges. If you have any more questions or would like to explore further, feel free to reach out. Thank you for your time today!
