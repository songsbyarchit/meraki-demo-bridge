Great, let's kick things off with a look at the Meraki Dashboard, our centralized platform that provides a single pane of glass view into your network. **Click on the 'Dashboard' tab** to get started.

**Navigate to 'Cameras' and select a camera feed** to see how easy it is to monitor multiple locations from one place.

Now, let's explore some key use cases for the Professional Services sector:
1. **Click on 'Motion Search' to quickly find specific events in your camera footage**

A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
