So, let's talk about the needs of Small Businesses. They often struggle with limited IT resources, lack of visibility into their network, and the complexity of managing multiple sites. This is where Meraki really shines.

Let's dive into some specific use cases. Imagine a small retail store with multiple locations. With Meraki, you can easily manage all your networks from one dashboard. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** and see real-time data on all connected devices.

Now, let's talk about a small manufacturing company. They need reliable connectivity for their machinery. With Meraki, you can quickly troubleshoot any network issues. **Click 'Monitor > Live Tools > Ping'** to test connectivity to specific devices.

Lastly, consider a small law firm that values security. Meraki offers built-in security features to protect your network. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security Appliance'** to view and configure security settings.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have:
