[Opening]

Hello everyone, welcome to our Meraki MT demo for small businesses. Today, we'll be focusing on how Meraki can help solve common pain points for small businesses and how you can effectively pitch this solution to your customers.

First, let's talk about some pain points that small businesses typically face. These include limited IT resources, the need for reliable and secure networking, and the desire for easy-to-use technology that doesn't require constant maintenance.

[Use Case 1: Network Visibility]
One of the key features of Meraki is its intuitive dashboard that provides real-time visibility into the network. This is especially important for small businesses that may not have dedicated IT staff. With Meraki, partners can offer their customers a solution that allows them to easily monitor and manage their network from anywhere. To demonstrate this, **click 'Dashboard'** and show the various network health metrics and device statuses.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi]
Another common pain point for small businesses is providing secure guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki, partners can set up a guest network with just a few clicks. This feature not only enhances the customer experience but also helps protect the main network from potential security threats. To showcase this, **click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** and set up a separate guest network with specific access controls.

[Use Case 3: Security]
Security is a top concern for small businesses, and Meraki offers advanced security features to address this. Partners can pitch Meraki as a comprehensive security solution that includes built-in firewall, intrusion prevention, content filtering, and more. To highlight this, **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat Protection'** and show how easy it is to configure security policies and monitor potential threats.

[Smart Questions]
As you pitch Meraki to customers, here are two smart questions you can ask to prompt discussion:
1. How do you currently manage your network and what challenges do you face?
2. What security measures do you have in place and are you confident in their effectiveness?

[Closing]
In conclusion, Meraki offers a simple and effective solution for small businesses to overcome common pain points such as limited IT resources, secure networking, and ease of use. By highlighting key use cases and asking smart questions, partners can effectively pitch Meraki to their customers and provide them with a reliable and scalable networking solution.
