With Meraki MX, you can easily set up secure VPN connections for remote workers or branch offices. **Click 'Configure > VPN > Site-to-Site VPN'**. This feature allows employees to access company resources securely from anywhere, ensuring business continuity and data protection."

[Use Case 2: Network Segmentation]

This feature helps businesses protect sensitive data and maintain network performance."

With Meraki MX, you can set up web filtering policies to block or allow specific categories of websites. **Click 'Configure > Content Filtering'**. This feature helps businesses enforce acceptable use policies and protect against malicious online content."
