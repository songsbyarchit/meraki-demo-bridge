Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo. We're excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki's MS product and how it can benefit small businesses. Before we dive in, let's start with a couple of warm-up questions tailored to your role as a partner:

- What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the small business sector?
- What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's jump into the demo and see how Meraki can address the pain points that small businesses care about.

**Use Case 1: Simplified Network Management**
Let's say you have multiple small business locations that need to be managed from a central location. With Meraki's Dashboard, you can **click 'Network-wide > Sites'** to easily view and manage all your sites in one place. This visibility and unified management make troubleshooting a breeze.

**Use Case 2: Secure Guest Access**
Small businesses often struggle with providing secure guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki, you can **click 'Wireless > Guest Access'** to set up secure guest networks with ease. This feature not only enhances security but also improves the overall customer experience.

**Use Case 3: Network Health Monitoring**
Keeping tabs on your network's health is crucial for small businesses. By **clicking 'Monitor > Appliance Status'**, you can quickly identify any issues and proactively address them before they impact your operations.

Now, let's address a couple of common questions that partners might have when pitching Meraki MS to small businesses:

Q: What are the top small business pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MS during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

That's it for our demo today. We hope you see the value that Meraki MS can bring to small businesses. Thank you for joining us!
