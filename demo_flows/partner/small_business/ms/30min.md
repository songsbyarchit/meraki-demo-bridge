[Slide 1: Introduction]
- Introduce yourself and your company.

[Slide 2: Pain Points]
- Small businesses often struggle with managing their network infrastructure efficiently and cost-effectively.
- They may lack the IT expertise and resources to handle complex networking solutions.
- Downtime can be detrimental to their business operations and bottom line.

[Slide 3: Meraki Solution]
- Meraki offers a cloud-managed networking solution that is simple, reliable, and secure.
- With Meraki, partners can easily deploy and manage networks remotely, saving time and resources.
- The centralized dashboard provides real-time insights and analytics to help troubleshoot issues quickly.

[Use Case 1: Remote Network Management]
- Imagine a small business with multiple locations. With Meraki, partners can **log into the dashboard** and manage all network devices from one place.
- They can **monitor network performance**, **configure switch ports**, and **set up VLANs** without needing to be physically present at each location.
- This level of remote management saves time and reduces the need for on-site visits, making it a cost-effective solution for small businesses.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Access]
- Another pain point for small businesses is providing secure and reliable guest Wi-Fi access.
- With Meraki, partners can **easily set up a guest network** with custom splash pages and access controls.
- This feature not only enhances the customer experience but also helps businesses collect valuable customer data for marketing purposes.

[Slide 4: Smart Questions]
1. How do you currently manage your network infrastructure across multiple locations?
2. What challenges do you face when it comes to providing guest Wi-Fi access?
3. Have you considered cloud-managed networking solutions before? If so, what was your experience like?
