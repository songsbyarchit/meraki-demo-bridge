Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's SM solution, specifically tailored for the Small Business sector.

Let's kick things off with a couple of warm-up questions:
- What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Small Business sector? 
- What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's dive into the demo.

First, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard, our central platform for unified management. **Click 'Dashboard'** to access the single pane of glass view. Here, you'll see all your network devices in one place, enabling visibility and simplified troubleshooting.

Next, let's explore a use case. Imagine a small retail store with multiple locations. With Meraki, you can easily manage all sites from one dashboard. **Click 'Configure > Network-wide settings'** to see how you can make changes across all sites simultaneously.

Another key use case is remote troubleshooting. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time client information and quickly identify and resolve issues, all from the Meraki Dashboard.

Now, let's address some common questions from partners in the Small Business space:

Q: What are the top small business pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thank you for joining me in this demo. Cisco Meraki's SM solution is a game-changer for Small Business networks, offering simplified management and enhanced visibility. Let's work together to help our customers thrive in this digital age.
