Presenter: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us for this Meraki SM demo targeted at the Small Business sector. Today, we will be discussing how Meraki can help solve common pain points for small businesses and how you can position Meraki to your customers. 

Let's start by talking about some pain points that small businesses often face. One common issue is the lack of IT resources and expertise. Small businesses usually don't have dedicated IT staff, so they need simple and easy-to-use solutions that can be managed by anyone. Another pain point is the need for reliable and secure networking solutions that can scale as the business grows.

Now, let's see how Meraki can address these pain points. Meraki offers a cloud-managed networking solution that is easy to deploy and manage. With Meraki, you can set up and manage your entire network from a single dashboard, making it easy for anyone to handle network configurations and troubleshooting. Plus, Meraki's built-in security features help protect your network from cyber threats, giving you peace of mind.

Let's dive into a couple of use cases to see Meraki in action. The first use case is setting up a guest network. With Meraki, you can easily create a separate guest network with just a few clicks. **Click 'Configure > Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a new SSID for the guest network. You can then set up access controls and policies to ensure that guests have limited access to your main network.

The second use case we'll look at is managing switch ports. With Meraki, you can easily configure and monitor switch ports from the dashboard. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to see all the connected devices and their traffic usage. You can also set up VLANs and access policies to ensure that your network is segmented and secure.

Now, let's wrap up with a few smart questions that you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:
1. How do you currently manage your network and what challenges do you face?
2. Have you experienced any security incidents in the past, and how do you currently protect your network?
3. What are your plans for future growth, and how do you see your network evolving to support that growth?

Thank you for joining us for this Meraki SM demo. If you have any further questions or would like to learn more about how Meraki can help your small business, feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
