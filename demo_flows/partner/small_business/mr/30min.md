Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo. I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MR can help address the unique needs of small businesses. Before we dive in, let me ask you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's explore how Meraki can make a difference for small businesses. Imagine a small retail store trying to provide guest Wi-Fi while ensuring secure connections for their point-of-sale devices. With **MR**, they can easily set up separate networks for guests and staff through the Meraki Dashboard.

Another common use case is a small office with limited IT resources struggling to manage multiple sites. **MR** simplifies this by allowing them to centrally manage all their networks from a single dashboard. Let's take a look at how easy it is to navigate the dashboard. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'**.

Now, let's consider a small manufacturing facility where downtime can be costly. With **MR**, they can quickly identify and troubleshoot connectivity issues using real-time diagnostics and alerts on the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Monitor > Wireless Health'** to see this in action.

When pitching **MR** to small businesses, you might be asked:
Q: What are the top small business pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

I hope this demo has shown you the value **MR** can bring to small businesses. Let's chat more about how we can position this solution effectively. Thank you for your time!
