Welcome everyone to our Meraki MR demo session! Today, we're going to focus on how Meraki MR can benefit small businesses and help you pitch it to your customers effectively.

Let's start by discussing some pain points that small businesses often face. One common issue is the lack of IT resources and expertise. Small businesses typically don't have dedicated IT staff to manage their network, which can lead to network downtime and security vulnerabilities.

Another pain point is the need for simple and centralized management. Small business owners want a network solution that is easy to set up and manage, without the need for complex configurations or constant monitoring.

This is where Meraki MR comes in. Meraki offers a cloud-managed networking solution that is easy to deploy and manage, even for businesses with limited IT resources. With Meraki, partners can provide their customers with a reliable and secure network that is centrally managed through a user-friendly dashboard.

Now, let's dive into some use cases that demonstrate the benefits of Meraki MR for small businesses.

Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi Access
Imagine a small cafe that wants to offer free Wi-Fi to its customers. With Meraki MR, partners can easily set up a guest Wi-Fi network that is isolated from the main network, ensuring security for both the business and its customers. By **clicking 'Wireless > SSIDs'**, partners can quickly configure a guest network with custom login pages and bandwidth limits.

Use Case 2: Remote Office Connectivity
For small businesses with remote offices or employees working from home, Meraki MR offers seamless connectivity through its cloud-managed VPN capabilities. Partners can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'** to easily set up secure connections between different locations, ensuring consistent network access and security.

Use Case 3: Application Visibility and Control
Small businesses often struggle with managing bandwidth usage and ensuring that critical applications have priority over non-essential ones. With Meraki MR, partners can **click 'Wireless > Air Marshal'** to monitor and control application usage on the network, ensuring optimal performance for key business applications.

Now, let's wrap up with a few smart questions that you can ask your customers to prompt discussion and showcase the value of Meraki MR:

1. How important is network reliability and security for your business, especially considering the increasing number of cyber threats?
2. Have you experienced any challenges with managing your current network infrastructure, and how do you envision a cloud-managed solution like Meraki MR addressing those challenges?
3. Are there any specific features or capabilities that you are looking for in a networking solution to meet your business needs effectively?
