[Opening]

Hello and welcome, everyone. Today, we're going to dive into a demo of Meraki SM tailored specifically for the retail sector. As partners, it's crucial to understand the pain points our retail customers face and how Meraki can address them effectively. Let's get started.

[Pain Points]

Now, when it comes to retail, one of the biggest pain points for our customers is the need for centralized management of their network infrastructure. With multiple stores spread across different locations, it can be challenging to ensure consistent network performance and security. This is where Meraki shines with its cloud-based dashboard that allows for easy management and monitoring of all network devices from a single interface.

Another pain point for retail customers is the need for reliable connectivity to support various applications such as POS systems, inventory management, and customer Wi-Fi. Meraki's robust network infrastructure ensures seamless connectivity and high performance, even during peak times.

[Use Case 1: Store Network Management]

Let's take a look at a common use case in retail - store network management. With Meraki SM, partners can easily configure and manage all network devices, from access points to switches, in each store location. By **clicking 'Configure > Switch ports'**, partners can quickly set up VLANs for different departments, prioritize traffic for POS systems, and monitor network performance in real-time.

[Use Case 2: Guest Wi-Fi Access]

Another key use case for retail is providing secure and reliable guest Wi-Fi access. With Meraki SM, partners can easily set up a separate guest network with customizable splash pages and bandwidth limits. By **clicking 'Wireless > SSIDs'**, partners can create a guest SSID, set up authentication options, and monitor guest traffic to ensure a seamless experience for customers.

[Smart Questions]

Now, as you pitch Meraki SM to retail customers, here are a few smart questions to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing your network infrastructure across multiple store locations?
2. What challenges have you faced in providing reliable connectivity for your store applications and customer Wi-Fi?
3. How important is network security and compliance for your retail business, and how do you currently address these concerns?

By showcasing the ease of centralized management, reliable connectivity, and secure guest Wi-Fi access, partners can position Meraki as the ideal choice for retail businesses.
