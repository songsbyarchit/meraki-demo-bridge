Hey there, thanks for joining me today for this demo! I know we're all busy, so let's dive right in. 

First off, for all our partners out there, I'm curious to hear about the trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in the Retail sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's talk about how **SM** can address those pain points. 

Imagine a retail environment where you need to manage multiple locations with different network requirements. **Click 'Network-wide > Overview'** on the Meraki Dashboard to see a holistic view of all your sites. This visibility allows you to quickly identify any issues and ensure consistent network performance across the board.

Next, let's tackle the headache of troubleshooting. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time client information and **click on a specific client** to view detailed insights. With this level of visibility, you can troubleshoot issues faster and keep your customers satisfied.

Now, let's talk about unified management. **Click 'Configure > Wireless settings'** to easily make changes that apply to all your sites simultaneously. This centralized approach saves time and ensures consistency in your network configurations.

Moving on to security, **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security policies'** to set up and enforce security policies across all your sites. With **SM**, you can ensure a secure network environment without the hassle of managing individual firewalls at each location.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching **SM** in the Retail space:

Q: What are the top retail pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position **SM** during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining me today, and I hope this demo has given you a good overview of how **SM** can benefit your retail customers. Let's keep the conversation going and find the best solution for their needs.
