Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. I know you're a partner reseller focused on the Retail sector, and I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MG can help address some of the challenges your customers are facing. Before we dive in, can you share what trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's get started. In the Retail sector, one common pain point is the need for seamless connectivity across multiple locations. With Meraki MG, you can easily manage and monitor all your retail sites from one central platform, the Meraki Dashboard.

Imagine being able to **view real-time network performance**, **troubleshoot connectivity issues**, and **push out configuration changes** across all your stores with just a few clicks. That's the power of Meraki's single pane of glass interface.

Let's take a look at a few specific use cases tailored to Retail:

1. **Monitoring POS System Connectivity** - Retailers rely heavily on their POS systems to process transactions. With Meraki MG, you can **set up alerts for offline POS devices**, **identify connectivity issues**, and **remotely troubleshoot network problems** to keep your sales running smoothly.

2. **Guest Wi-Fi Management** - Providing secure guest Wi-Fi is crucial for enhancing the customer experience. With Meraki, you can **create custom splash pages**, **limit bandwidth usage**, and **capture customer data** for marketing purposes, all through the intuitive Dashboard.

Now, let's navigate to the Dashboard and **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to see an overview of all your retail locations. From here, you can easily **monitor client connections**, **configure SSIDs**, and **run network-wide speed tests**.
