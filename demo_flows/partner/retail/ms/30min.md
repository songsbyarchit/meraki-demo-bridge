Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I know you're a partner reseller, and our goal here is to help you pitch Cisco Meraki to your customers in the Retail sector. Before we dive in, could you share any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this space? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in Retail?

Great, let's get started. Imagine you're working with a retail customer who is struggling with network visibility, slow troubleshooting, and managing multiple sites. This is where Cisco Meraki MS comes in. With the Meraki Dashboard as the central platform, you get a single pane of glass view that simplifies troubleshooting and unifies management across all locations.

Let's walk through a couple of specific use cases to showcase the power of Meraki MS in the Retail sector. First, imagine a scenario where a store manager needs to quickly identify and resolve network issues impacting POS systems during peak hours. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** on the Dashboard to see real-time client connectivity and **click 'Tools > Ping'** to troubleshoot connectivity to specific devices.

Another common pain point in retail is ensuring secure guest Wi-Fi access while protecting sensitive data on the corporate network. With Meraki MS, you can easily segment guest traffic and apply firewall rules to restrict access. **Click 'Configure > Wireless settings'** to set up a guest SSID and **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to create rules for traffic isolation.

Now, let's address some questions partners often have when positioning Meraki MS in the Retail space:

Q: What are the top retail pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MS during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for going through this demo with me. I hope it gave you a good sense of how Cisco Meraki MS can address the unique challenges faced by retail customers. Let's chat more about how we can tailor this solution to meet the specific needs of your clients.
