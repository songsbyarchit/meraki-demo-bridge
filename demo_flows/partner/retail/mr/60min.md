[Slide: Pain Points in Retail]

In the retail sector, one of the most significant pain points is ensuring seamless connectivity for customers and employees. With the increasing demand for online shopping and in-store experiences, retailers need a reliable and secure network to support their operations. Traditional networking solutions can be complex to manage and prone to downtime, leading to lost sales and frustrated customers.

This level of visibility and control is crucial for retail businesses looking to provide a seamless and secure experience for their customers.

[Use Case 1: Guest Wi-Fi]

One common use case in retail is providing guest Wi-Fi for customers. With Meraki MR, partners can quickly set up a guest network with customizable splash pages and bandwidth controls.
