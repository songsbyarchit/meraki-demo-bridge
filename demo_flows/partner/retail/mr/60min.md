Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I see you’re a partner reseller, so I’m excited to show you how Cisco Meraki’s MR solution can benefit your retail customers. What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let’s dive into the demo now. Imagine you're working with a retail customer who is struggling with network visibility and management across multiple locations. This is where Meraki shines. With our centralized dashboard, you can easily monitor, troubleshoot, and manage all your retail sites from a single pane of glass.

**Use Case 1:** **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** - Here, you can see all your MR devices across different locations, check their status, and quickly identify any connectivity issues.

**Use Case 2:** **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** - You can set up firewall rules to secure each store's network and ensure PCI compliance for all payment transactions.

**Use Case 3:** **click 'Clients' > 'Wireless Clients'** - Easily track foot traffic by analyzing the number of unique wireless clients in each store over time.

**Use Case 4:** **click 'Network-wide > Traffic analytics'** - Understand which applications are consuming the most bandwidth at each location and optimize network performance accordingly.

Now, let’s address some common questions partners like you might encounter when pitching MR to retail customers:

Q: What are the top retail pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
