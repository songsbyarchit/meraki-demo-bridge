Hey there, thanks for joining us today! I know you're a partner in the retail sector, so I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki can help you address some of the common challenges you might be facing. 

Before we dive in, can you share with me any trends or challenges you're seeing with your customers in the retail sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's get started. Imagine you're a retail IT admin looking to streamline your network management. With Meraki, you can easily monitor and control all your locations from one central platform - the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Dashboard' on the top menu bar** to see how it provides a single pane of glass view for all your network devices.

Now, let's talk about some specific use cases for Meraki in the retail sector. One key pain point for retailers is ensuring seamless connectivity for customers while maintaining network security. With Meraki, you can **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to set up guest Wi-Fi networks with ease and **click 'Security > Content Filtering'** to ensure a safe browsing experience for all users.

Another common challenge is managing multiple locations efficiently. **Click 'Organization > Inventory'** to see how Meraki allows you to easily deploy and manage devices across all your stores from one interface. You can even **click 'Network-wide > Configure > General'** to set up templates for consistent network policies across all sites.

When it comes to troubleshooting network issues, time is of the essence. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to quickly identify and resolve connectivity issues for individual devices. The Meraki Dashboard provides real-time visibility into your network, making it easier to pinpoint and resolve issues fast.

As a partner reseller, you might wonder about the top retail pain points that Meraki addresses. Typically, lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites are key areas where Meraki shines. Emphasize Meraki's ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security during your pitch. 

In terms of installation or deployment concerns, it's usually plug-and-play with Meraki. Just ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready to go for a seamless setup process.
