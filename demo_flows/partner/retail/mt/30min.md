Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo. I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki can revolutionize the retail sector. Before we dive in, let's talk about what you're seeing in the industry. What trends or challenges are you facing with customers in retail?

Great insights. Let's explore how Meraki can address those pain points. Imagine a retail chain with multiple locations. With Meraki Dashboard, you can **monitor all sites from one place**. No more jumping between different systems. **Click 'Network-wide > Overview'** to see a snapshot of your entire network.

Now, let's talk about troubleshooting. When issues arise, you need to act fast. With Meraki, **you can pinpoint the problem in seconds**. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see who's having connectivity issues. From there, **click on a specific client to troubleshoot further**.

One more use case: Let's say you're opening a new store. Instead of setting up each device manually, **use templates to deploy configurations in minutes**. **Click 'Configure > Templates'** to see how easy it is to roll out changes across all locations.

Partner questions:
