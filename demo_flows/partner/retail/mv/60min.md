Hey there, thanks for joining us today! I know you're a partner reseller in the retail sector, and we're here to help you pitch Cisco Meraki's MV solution to your customers. Before we dive in, could you share any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this space? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in the retail sector?

Great, let's jump into the demo. So, in the retail sector, one of the biggest pain points we hear from customers is the need for better visibility into their stores, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management across multiple locations. This is where Meraki MV comes in.

**Use case 1: Loss Prevention**
Let's **click 'Cameras > Live'** on the Meraki Dashboard. With MV cameras, retailers can easily monitor their stores in real-time, helping to prevent theft and ensure a safe shopping environment.

**Use case 2: Customer Analytics**
Now, **click 'Cameras > Analytics'**. MV cameras not only provide security but also valuable insights into customer behavior, helping retailers optimize store layouts and improve the overall shopping experience.

**Use case 3: Remote Management**
Next, let's **click 'Organizations > Inventory'**. With the Meraki Dashboard, retailers can remotely manage and monitor all their MV cameras across different locations from a single pane of glass, saving time and resources.

**Use case 4: Seamless Integration**
Now, **click 'Cameras > Settings'**. MV cameras seamlessly integrate with other Meraki products like wireless access points and switches, creating a unified network infrastructure that is easy to deploy and manage.

When positioning MV in the retail space, partners often ask:
Q: What are the top retail pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MV during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining the demo today, and I hope this helps you better pitch Meraki MV to your retail customers!
