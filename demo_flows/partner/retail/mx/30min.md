Hey there! Thanks for joining me today for this demo on Cisco Meraki's MX solution, tailored specifically for our partners in the Retail sector. 

To kick things off, let's chat a bit about what trends or challenges you're noticing with customers in this space. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in the Retail sector?

Now, let's dive into the demo. Imagine a retail chain with multiple locations spread out across the country. With Meraki MX, you can easily manage and monitor all your sites from one central platform. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Overview'** to see a snapshot of all your locations at a glance.

One common pain point in retail is ensuring secure payment transactions. With Meraki MX, you can set up secure VPN connections between your stores and headquarters to protect sensitive customer data. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-site VPN'** to see how easy it is to configure.

Another challenge in retail is providing reliable guest Wi-Fi for customers. With Meraki MX, you can create a separate network for guests while keeping your internal network secure. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to set up a guest network with just a few clicks.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching MX in the Retail space:

Q: What are the top retail pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MX during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining me today! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can show you.
