Hey there, thanks for joining me today. I know you're a partner in the retail sector, and we're here to walk through a demo of how Cisco Meraki's MX can address the pain points your customers are facing. 

To kick things off, can you share any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in the retail sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's dive in. So, in the retail sector, one of the biggest pain points we often hear about is the need for visibility and simplified management across multiple locations. With Cisco Meraki's MX, we can address these challenges head-on.

First off, let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard. This is where all the magic happens. **Log in to the Meraki Dashboard** and **click on the MX device**. Here, you'll see a centralized view of all your network devices, making it easy to manage and troubleshoot.

Now, let's talk about some specific use cases in the retail sector. **Click on 'Security & SD-WAN > SD-WAN & Traffic Shaping'**. With Meraki MX, you can easily prioritize network traffic to ensure your POS systems have the bandwidth they need during peak hours.

Next, **navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Threat Protection'**. Here, you can see real-time threat alerts and easily configure firewall rules to protect your network from cyber threats, which is crucial in the retail industry.

Another key feature for retailers is **clicking on 'Security & SD-WAN > AMP'**. This gives you advanced malware protection, helping to keep your customers' data safe and secure.

Lastly, let's talk about remote locations. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Appliance Status'**. With Meraki MX, you can easily deploy and manage network devices across multiple sites from one central location, saving time and resources.

Now, as a partner, you might be wondering how to best position Meraki MX in the retail space. The top pain points this solution addresses are typically lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

When pitching MX, emphasize Meraki's ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security. And when it comes to installation or deployment concerns, it's usually plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

I hope this demo has been helpful in showcasing the power of Cisco Meraki MX for the retail sector. Feel free to ask any questions you might have about positioning MX to your customers.
