Host: Good morning/afternoon everyone! Thank you for joining us for this Meraki SM demo focusing on the Higher Ed sector. Today, we will be discussing how Meraki can help address the pain points that Higher Ed institutions face and how you can position Meraki to your customers. Let's dive in.

1. Pain Points in Higher Ed:
- One of the main pain points in the Higher Ed sector is the need for seamless and secure network management across multiple campuses. With different departments, buildings, and devices spread out, it can be a challenge to maintain visibility and control.
- Another pain point is student engagement and satisfaction. Students expect fast and reliable Wi-Fi access, which can be difficult to achieve with outdated network solutions.
- Lastly, network security is a top concern for Higher Ed institutions. With the abundance of personal devices and sensitive data being shared, it's crucial to have a robust security solution in place.

2. Positioning Meraki:
- Meraki offers a cloud-managed solution that provides centralized visibility and control over your network. With a user-friendly dashboard, **click 'Dashboard'**, you can easily monitor and manage all your devices from one place.
- Meraki's seamless integration with other Cisco products allows for a holistic network solution, ensuring a smooth and secure network experience for students and faculty.
- By leveraging Meraki's advanced security features, such as content filtering and threat protection, Higher Ed institutions can protect their network from cyber threats and ensure data privacy.

3. Use Cases:
- Use Case 1: **click 'Configure > Switch ports'**. Show how easy it is to configure switch ports for different devices, such as printers, computers, and access points. This can help streamline network management and ensure optimal performance.
- Use Case 2: **click 'Wireless > Access Points'**. Demonstrate how Meraki's access points can provide seamless Wi-Fi coverage across campus, ensuring fast and reliable connectivity for students and faculty.
- Use Case 3: **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'**. Showcase how Meraki's content filtering feature can help block inappropriate websites and protect students from harmful content while browsing the internet.
