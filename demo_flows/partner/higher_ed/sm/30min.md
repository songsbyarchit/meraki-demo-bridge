Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo on Cisco Meraki's SM solution. I'm excited to dive into how we can help you better serve your customers in the Higher Education sector. Before we get started, let's warm up with a couple of questions tailored to your role:

For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Higher Education sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's jump into the demo.

**Use Case 1: Campus Network Management**  
Let's say you're an IT admin at a large university with multiple campuses. With Meraki's SM solution, you can easily manage all your network devices from a single dashboard. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** to see real-time client activity across all sites.

**Use Case 2: Device Configuration and Security**  
Imagine you need to push out a software update to all the laptops in a lecture hall. With Meraki, you can **click 'Systems Manager > Manage > Profiles'** to deploy updates and ensure all devices are up to date and secure.

**Use Case 3: Troubleshooting and Alerts**  
If a student reports slow Wi-Fi in the dorms, you can quickly identify the issue by **clicking 'Wireless > Monitor > Access Points'** to see performance metrics and troubleshoot from the dashboard.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have:

Q: What are the top Higher Education pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?  
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
