Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki and how our MS solution can benefit Higher Education institutions.

Let's dive in with a quick question for you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Higher Education sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Now, let's explore how Meraki MS can address the pain points in Higher Education. One common challenge is managing multiple sites and ensuring network visibility. With Meraki Dashboard as the central platform, you can have a single pane of glass view across all your campuses, making troubleshooting and management a breeze.

Imagine a scenario where a student dorm loses network connectivity. With Meraki MS, you can quickly identify the issue by **clicking 'Monitor > Clients'** in the Dashboard, pinpointing the problem and resolving it in no time.

Another use case is ensuring network security on campus. By **navigating to 'Security & SD-WAN > Security policies'** in the Dashboard, you can easily configure and enforce security policies to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching Meraki MS in the Higher Education space:

Q: What are the top Higher Education pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MS during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for exploring Meraki MS with me today. I hope you can see the value it brings to Higher Education institutions. Let's work together to make networking simpler and more efficient for our customers.
