[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MS demo for the Higher Ed sector. Today, we're going to show you how Meraki can address some of the pain points that Higher Ed institutions face when it comes to managing their network infrastructure.

[Slide 1: Introduction to Meraki MS]
Let's start by introducing Meraki MS. Meraki MS is a cloud-managed switch solution that provides centralized management, visibility, and control over your network infrastructure. With Meraki, you can easily deploy and manage switches across multiple locations from a single dashboard.

[Slide 2: Pain points in Higher Ed]
Higher Ed institutions often face challenges when it comes to managing their network infrastructure. Some of the pain points they care about include:
- Limited IT resources and budget
- Ensuring network security and compliance
- Providing reliable and high-performance connectivity for students and faculty

[Slide 3: Use case 1 - Simplified Deployment]
One use case where Meraki MS can help is in simplifying deployment. With Meraki's zero-touch provisioning, you can easily deploy switches at multiple locations without the need for on-site IT staff. Simply plug in the switch, and it will automatically connect to the Meraki dashboard for configuration.
