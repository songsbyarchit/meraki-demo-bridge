Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's MS product, specifically tailored for the Higher Education sector. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you:

- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's get started with a use case that higher education institutions often face. Imagine a scenario where a university has multiple campuses spread across a city. With **Meraki Dashboard**, you can easily manage all these sites from a single pane of glass. **Click 'Networks > All networks'** to see how effortless it is to monitor and troubleshoot any issues across different locations.

Another common pain point in higher education is the need for secure and reliable Wi-Fi access for students and faculty. By **clicking 'Wireless > Access points'**, you can quickly configure and ensure seamless connectivity throughout the campus, all from one centralized dashboard.

Next, let's consider the challenge of network segmentation within a university setting. With **Meraki MS**, you can easily create different VLANs for students, staff, and guests. **Click 'Switch > Switch ports'** to see how simple it is to set up and manage these network segments, ensuring security and compliance.

Another crucial aspect for higher education institutions is ensuring a smooth onboarding process for new devices. **Click 'Systems manager > Devices'** to witness how easy it is to enroll and manage devices, whether it's laptops for students or IoT devices for research labs.

Moving on, let's explore a scenario where a university wants to provide seamless video conferencing capabilities for remote learning. By **clicking 'Security & SD-WAN > SD-WAN'**, you can prioritize traffic and optimize network performance, ensuring high-quality video calls without any interruptions.

Last but not least, let's address the need for seamless integration with existing IT infrastructure. With **Meraki APIs**, you can easily integrate MS switches with other systems and applications, streamlining workflows and enhancing overall efficiency. **Click 'Organization > Settings > Dashboard API access'** to see how straightforward it is to enable API access.

Now, let's wrap up with some common questions you might encounter when pitching MS in the Higher Education space:

Q: What are the top higher education pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MS during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
