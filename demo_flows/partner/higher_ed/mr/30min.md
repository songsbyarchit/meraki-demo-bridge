[Opening]

Hello everyone and welcome to our Meraki MR demo today! Today, we'll be focusing on how Meraki can benefit the Higher Ed sector. As a partner, it's important to understand the pain points our customers care about and how Meraki can address them effectively. 

[Pain Points and Positioning]

In the Higher Ed sector, one of the key pain points is managing a large number of devices and users on the network. This can lead to network congestion, security vulnerabilities, and difficulty in troubleshooting issues. Meraki's cloud-managed approach simplifies network management, offers real-time visibility, and provides easy scalability. This allows Higher Ed institutions to focus on providing a seamless and secure network experience for students, faculty, and staff.

[Use Case 1: Onboarding New Students]

Let's dive into our first use case. When it's time to onboard new students at the beginning of the semester, there can be a surge in network activity as students connect their devices to the network. With Meraki, partners can easily **click 'Configure > Wireless > Splash Page'** to create a customized onboarding experience for new students. This not only ensures a smooth onboarding process but also allows the institution to gather valuable information about their users.

[Use Case 2: Network Security]

Moving on to our second use case - network security. Higher Ed institutions often deal with sensitive data and the need to protect against cyber threats. With Meraki's integrated security features, partners can **click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to set up policies that help prevent unauthorized access and protect against malware. This proactive approach to network security gives customers peace of mind knowing their data is secure.

[Use Case 3: Location Analytics]

Our final use case revolves around location analytics. In a Higher Ed setting, understanding how students move around campus can provide insights for optimizing resources and improving the overall student experience. Partners can **click 'Configure > Wireless > Location Analytics'** to access real-time data on user movement patterns. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions on campus layout, resource allocation, and more.

[Smart Questions]

Now, let's end with a few smart questions you can ask attendees to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing network onboarding for new students, and what challenges have you faced in the past?
2. What measures do you have in place to ensure network security for your institution, and how do you stay ahead of emerging threats?
3. Have you considered leveraging location analytics to optimize resources and enhance the student experience on campus?

Thank you for joining our Meraki MR demo today. We hope you found the information valuable and are excited to help you pitch Meraki to your Higher Ed customers.
