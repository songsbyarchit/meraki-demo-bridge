Hey there, thank you for joining us today. I wanted to touch base with you as a partner reseller and discuss how we can effectively pitch Cisco Meraki's MR product to customers in the Higher Education sector.

To kick things off, I'd love to hear from you about the trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this space. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in Higher Education?

Great, let's dive into the demo now. Imagine you're presenting to a Higher Education customer. One of the pain points they often face is the complexity of managing multiple sites. With Meraki's single pane of glass Dashboard, you can easily oversee all your networks in one place. **Click 'Network-wide > Monitor > Overview'** to see how this works.

Another use case for Higher Education is the need for visibility into network performance. Troubleshooting issues quickly is essential to keep the network running smoothly. **Click 'Wireless > Access points'** to view real-time data and **click on a specific AP** to see detailed information.

Lastly, let's talk about unified management. Higher Education institutions often have diverse network needs across campuses. Meraki's Dashboard allows you to configure and monitor all your devices from one central platform. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to see how easy it is to make changes across your network.

Now, let's address a couple of common partner questions when positioning MR in Higher Education:

Q: What are the top Higher Education pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
