Hey there, and welcome to this demo of Cisco Meraki, specifically focusing on our MG product tailored for the Higher Education sector. Whether you're a partner reseller, customer IT admin, or an internal SE, I'm excited to show you how Meraki can help address the unique challenges faced in this space.

To kick things off, let's start with a couple of warm-up questions:
- For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Higher Education sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
- For customers: What does your current network setup look like in the Higher Education sector? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
- For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in Higher Education? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Now, let's dive into the demo with a focus on Higher Education use cases:

1. **Student Dormitories**: **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a separate SSID for student devices, ensuring secure access while maintaining network performance.
   
2. **Classroom Connectivity**: **click 'Switch > Switch ports'** to configure QoS settings for classroom switches, prioritizing traffic for real-time applications like video conferencing.
   
3. **Campus Security**: **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Security policies'** to set up firewall rules to protect sensitive data and block unauthorized access.
   
4. **Guest Network**: **click 'Wireless > Splash page'** to create a customized login portal for guests visiting the campus, providing secure but seamless access.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might encounter when pitching MG in Higher Education:

Q: What are the top Higher Education pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MG during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
