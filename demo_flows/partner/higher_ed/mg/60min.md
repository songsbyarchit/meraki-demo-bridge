[Opening]
Hello everyone, and welcome to our Meraki MG demo today! I'm excited to show you how our solution can revolutionize network connectivity in the Higher Ed sector. As partners, you play a crucial role in helping customers navigate the rapidly evolving technology landscape, and Meraki is here to support you every step of the way.

[Pain Points]
Let's start by addressing some pain points that Higher Ed institutions often face when it comes to network connectivity. Slow and unreliable internet can hinder student learning and research activities. Network downtime can disrupt online courses and exams, causing frustration for both students and faculty. Security threats are also a major concern, as institutions need to protect sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber attacks.

[Positioning Meraki]
This is where Meraki comes in. Our cloud-managed networking solutions provide seamless connectivity, robust security features, and central management capabilities, making it easy for Higher Ed institutions to deploy and maintain a reliable network infrastructure. With Meraki, you can offer your customers peace of mind knowing that their network is secure, scalable, and easy to manage.

[Use Cases]

1. **Bandwidth Management**: With Meraki MG, you can easily prioritize network traffic to ensure critical applications, such as online exams or video conferences, have sufficient bandwidth. This helps prevent network congestion and ensures a smooth user experience for students and faculty.

2. **Guest Wi-Fi Access**: Higher Ed institutions often have a large number of visitors on campus. With Meraki MG, you can set up guest Wi-Fi networks with customizable access controls, allowing visitors to connect securely without compromising the main network's security.
