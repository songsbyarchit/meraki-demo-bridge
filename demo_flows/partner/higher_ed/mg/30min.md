[Opening]

Hello and welcome, everyone. Today, we're going to dive into a demo of the Meraki MG, specifically tailored for the Higher Ed sector. As a Partner, it's important to understand the pain points that Higher Ed institutions face and how Meraki can help address them. Let's get started.

[Pain Points]

Higher Ed institutions often struggle with managing a large number of devices across sprawling campuses. This can lead to network congestion, security vulnerabilities, and difficulty in providing seamless connectivity for students, faculty, and staff. Traditional networking solutions may not be equipped to handle the dynamic and diverse needs of these institutions.

[Positioning]

Meraki offers a cloud-managed solution that provides visibility and control over the entire network infrastructure, from switches to access points to security appliances. With centralized management and automatic updates, Meraki simplifies network operations and ensures a secure and reliable connection for all users.

[Use Case 1: Device Onboarding]

Let's consider a common use case in Higher Ed: device onboarding for students. With Meraki, partners can easily set up a self-service portal for students to register their devices on the network. This not only streamlines the onboarding process but also enhances security by ensuring that only authorized devices are connected.

To set up a self-service portal, **navigate to 'Wireless > Configure > Access Control'** and enable the self-registration option. Students can then access the portal through a web browser and register their devices with ease.

[Use Case 2: Traffic Management]

Another challenge faced by Higher Ed institutions is managing network traffic during peak usage times, such as exam periods or registration days. With Meraki, partners can prioritize critical applications and allocate bandwidth effectively to ensure a smooth user experience for all users.

To configure traffic management rules, **click 'Configure > Traffic shaping'** and set priorities for different types of traffic, such as video conferencing or online exams. This ensures that essential services are given precedence during busy periods.

[Smart Questions]

Now, here are a couple of smart questions you can ask your customers to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently manage device onboarding for students, faculty, and staff? Are there any pain points or security concerns in this process?
2. How do you handle network congestion during peak usage times, and what impact does it have on user experience and productivity?

[Closing]

In conclusion, Meraki offers a comprehensive solution for Higher Ed institutions to address their networking challenges and provide a seamless connectivity experience for all users. By understanding the pain points of customers and positioning Meraki as a reliable and secure solution, partners can effectively pitch and demonstrate the value of Meraki MG in the Higher Ed sector.
