[Opening]
Presenter: Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MT demo targeting the Higher Ed sector. Today, we will be focusing on how Meraki can address the pain points that higher education institutions face and how you can position Meraki to potential customers. 

[Pain Points]
Presenter: So, let's talk about some pain points that higher education institutions care about. One common pain point is the need for a reliable and secure network infrastructure to support the growing number of devices on campus. Another pain point is the complexity of managing different network devices across multiple buildings and campuses. Lastly, there is a need for network visibility and control to ensure a seamless and secure experience for students and faculty.

[Positioning Meraki]
Presenter: Now, let's discuss how you can position Meraki to address these pain points. Meraki offers a cloud-managed networking solution that provides centralized management, visibility, and control over your network infrastructure. With Meraki, you can easily deploy and manage network devices across multiple locations from a single dashboard, making it a perfect solution for higher education institutions with complex network needs.

[Use Case 1: Campus-wide Network Deployment]
Presenter: Let's dive into a use case. Imagine a higher education institution with multiple buildings spread across a campus. With Meraki, you can easily deploy and manage network devices such as switches, access points, and security appliances across the entire campus from a centralized dashboard. Simply **click 'Configure > Network-wide > Devices'** to see all your devices and their status in one place.

[Use Case 2: Network Segmentation for Faculty and Students]
Presenter: Another use case is network segmentation for different user groups. Higher education institutions often need to provide different levels of access and security for faculty, students, and guests. With Meraki, you can easily create separate VLANs and apply different access policies for each user group. Simply **click 'Configure > VLANs'** to set up VLANs and **click 'Access Control'** to define access policies.

[Use Case 3: Real-time Network Monitoring]
Presenter: Lastly, let's talk about real-time network monitoring. With Meraki, you can monitor the health and performance of your network in real-time and receive alerts for any issues. Simply **click 'Monitor > Overview'** to see an overview of your network health and **click 'Alerts'** to set up alerts for specific events.

[Smart Questions]
Presenter: Now, here are two smart questions you can ask potential customers to prompt discussion:
1. How are you currently managing your network infrastructure across multiple locations?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face in ensuring network security and visibility on campus?

[Closing]
Presenter: Thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MT demo. We hope you found it informative and useful for pitching Meraki to potential customers in the Higher Ed sector. If you have any further questions or would like to schedule a follow-up demo, please feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
