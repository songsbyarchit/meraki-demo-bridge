Hey there, thanks for joining me today! I know we have a lot to cover, so let's dive right in. As a partner in the Financial Services sector, I'm sure you're familiar with the unique challenges and trends in this industry. What are some of the pain points you're seeing with your customers, and what do you find tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let's talk about how Meraki MX can address these challenges. One of the key use cases in the Financial Services sector is secure branch connectivity. With **click 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN > Add a VPN'**, you can easily set up secure connections between branches and headquarters, ensuring data privacy and compliance.

Another common use case is network segmentation for compliance. By **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Addressing & VLANs'**, you can create isolated network segments for different departments or functions, helping you meet regulatory requirements while maintaining network performance.

Lastly, let's not forget about cloud-managed security. With **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'**, you can easily enforce web filtering policies across all your branches from a single dashboard. This not only improves security but also simplifies management and troubleshooting.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching Meraki MX in the Financial Services space:

Q: What are the top financial services pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MX during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for your time today, and I hope this demo has given you a better understanding of how Meraki MX can help address the specific needs of the Financial Services sector. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
