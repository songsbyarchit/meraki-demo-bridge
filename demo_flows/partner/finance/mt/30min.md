[Opening]

Hello and welcome to our Meraki MT demo for the Finance sector. Today, we'll be exploring how Meraki's cloud-managed networking solutions can help address some of the key pain points that finance customers care about. As a partner, it's crucial to understand these pain points and position Meraki as the ideal solution.

[Pain Points]

Finance customers often face challenges such as network security, compliance with regulations, and the need for reliable and scalable networking solutions. They also value simplicity and ease of management, as IT resources in finance organizations are often stretched thin.

[Use Case 1: Network Security]

Let's dive into our first use case: network security. With Meraki, partners can offer finance customers a comprehensive security solution that includes features such as next-generation firewall, intrusion prevention, and content filtering. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to see how easy it is to configure and manage security policies across the entire network.

[Use Case 2: Compliance with Regulations]

Another pain point for finance customers is compliance with regulations such as PCI DSS and GDPR. Meraki's centralized dashboard allows partners to quickly assess compliance status and generate reports for audits. **Click 'Monitor > Security Center'** to see how Meraki simplifies compliance management for finance organizations.

[Use Case 3: Scalability and Reliability]

Lastly, finance customers often require scalable and reliable networking solutions to support their growing business needs. Meraki's cloud-managed architecture enables partners to easily expand the network, add new devices, and ensure high availability. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to see how simple it is to configure and manage network devices with Meraki.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with the attendees, here are two smart questions to ask:
1. How are you currently managing network security and compliance in your finance organization?
2. What challenges have you faced in scaling your network infrastructure to support business growth?

[Closing]

In conclusion, by understanding the pain points that finance customers care about and positioning Meraki as a solution that addresses these challenges, partners can effectively pitch Meraki to finance organizations. Remember to highlight the simplicity, security, and scalability that Meraki offers to differentiate it from traditional networking solutions.
