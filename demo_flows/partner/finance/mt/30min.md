Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I’m excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki and how our **MT** solution can benefit your customers in the Financial Services sector.

Before we dive in, I’d love to hear from you:
- What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Financial Services sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Let’s start with a use case that resonates with many financial services companies. **Click 'Wireless > Access points'** on the Meraki Dashboard to see how easy it is to manage multiple locations from one central platform. This is especially helpful for banks or credit unions with branch offices spread out across different cities.

Another common pain point in this sector is ensuring network security and compliance. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Security appliance'** on the Dashboard to see how Meraki simplifies security management and offers built-in features like content filtering and intrusion prevention.

Lastly, let's consider the need for reliable connectivity in financial services. **Click 'Monitor > Performance'** on the Dashboard to view real-time network performance metrics and quickly identify any issues affecting user experience.

Now, let’s address some common questions partners might have when positioning MT in the Financial Services space:
Q: What are the top financial services pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MT during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for your time today! I hope this demo has given you a good sense of how Cisco Meraki can address the specific needs of customers in the Financial Services sector.
