Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo of Cisco Meraki, tailored specifically for partners in the Financial Services sector. I'm excited to show you how our Meraki **MT** solution can address the unique challenges faced by your customers in this industry.

Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you about the trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in Financial Services. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, thanks for sharing that insight. Let's jump into the demo and explore how Meraki can help. 

**Use Case 1: Centralized Management**
Let's start by logging into the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Login' and enter your credentials**. Once inside, you'll see how the Meraki Dashboard provides a single pane of glass for managing all your network devices across different branches or offices, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

**Use Case 2: Network Segmentation**
Now, let's set up different network segments for your financial departments. **Click 'Configure > VLANs'** to create separate networks for accounting, HR, and IT. This segmentation enhances security and compliance by restricting access to sensitive data.

**Use Case 3: Security & Compliance**
Next, let's ensure compliance by configuring firewall rules to restrict access to certain websites or applications. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to create policies that align with regulatory requirements and protect your network from cyber threats.

**Use Case 4: Remote Workforce Support**
Given the current remote work trend, let's set up a VPN for secure access to the network from anywhere. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > VPN'** to configure a VPN connection for your employees working from home or on the go.

**Use Case 5: Guest Wi-Fi**
Lastly, let's enable a guest Wi-Fi network for visitors to your branches. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** to create a separate network with limited access to your internal resources, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for your guests.

**Use Case 6: Analytics & Reporting**
Before we wrap up, let's take a quick look at the analytics and reporting capabilities of the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Monitor > Analytics'** to gain insights into network performance, user activity, and application usage, helping you make data-driven decisions for your business.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MT in the Financial Services space:

Q: What are the top financial services pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MT during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thank you for joining this demo today. I hope you can see the value that Cisco Meraki **MT** can bring to your customers in the Financial Services sector. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance in positioning Meraki for your clients.
