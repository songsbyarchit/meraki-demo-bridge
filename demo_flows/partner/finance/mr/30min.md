Demo Script:

Good morning/afternoon everyone, thank you for joining this Meraki MR demo specifically tailored for the Finance sector. Today, we will be focusing on how Meraki can help address some of the pain points that are prevalent in the financial industry.

Let's start by discussing some of the common challenges that finance customers face. Security is a top concern - with the increasing amount of sensitive data being handled, ensuring a secure network is crucial. Additionally, the need for reliable and high-performance connectivity is essential for smooth operations. Lastly, the ability to easily manage and monitor network infrastructure across multiple locations is a key requirement for finance companies.

Now, let's dive into how Meraki can address these pain points. With its cloud-managed architecture, Meraki offers a centralized platform for easy network deployment and management. This means that partners can set up and configure network devices across multiple locations from a single dashboard, saving time and resources.

One use case that showcases this is the ability to **configure VPN settings** for secure remote access. Finance companies often have employees working from different locations, and having a secure VPN connection is crucial for accessing sensitive data. With Meraki, partners can easily set up and manage VPN connections through the dashboard, ensuring secure remote access for employees.

Another key feature of Meraki is its advanced security capabilities, such as **creating firewall rules** to protect the network from cyber threats. Finance companies handle a lot of sensitive data, and a breach could have severe consequences. By leveraging Meraki's built-in security features, partners can help customers strengthen their network defenses and prevent potential security incidents.

Lastly, let's talk about the importance of network performance in the finance sector. With Meraki's intelligent traffic shaping and Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities, partners can prioritize critical applications to ensure smooth operations. This is especially important for finance companies that rely on real-time data processing and communication.

To wrap up, here are a few smart questions that partners can ask finance customers during discussions:

1. How are you currently managing network security across multiple locations, and are you facing any challenges in ensuring a secure network environment?
2. Can you share any recent incidents where network performance issues have impacted your operations, and how are you currently addressing these challenges?
3. What are your key priorities when it comes to network management and monitoring, and how do you see Meraki potentially addressing these needs?

Thank you for your time, and we look forward to helping you pitch Meraki to your finance customers. If you have any questions or would like a more in-depth demo, please feel free to reach out.
