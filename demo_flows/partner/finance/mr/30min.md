Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo focused on Cisco Meraki's MR product, tailored specifically for the Financial Services sector. As a partner in this space, you're probably familiar with the unique challenges and opportunities that come with selling solutions to financial institutions. So, let's dive right in!

To start off, what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in the Financial Services sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, thanks for sharing that. Now, let's explore how Meraki MR can address some of these pain points.

Imagine a scenario where a financial institution needs to ensure secure and reliable Wi-Fi access for both employees and customers across multiple branches. With Meraki MR, you can easily **click 'Wireless > SSIDs'** on the dashboard to set up separate networks for staff and visitors, with different security policies in place.

Another common use case in this sector is the need for seamless connectivity for mobile banking applications. By **clicking 'Wireless > Air Marshall'**, you can monitor and mitigate any rogue access points that could pose a security risk to your network.

And let's not forget about the importance of compliance in the Financial Services industry. With Meraki MR, you can **click 'Wireless > Client details'** to quickly identify and troubleshoot any compliance issues, ensuring that your network is always in line with industry regulations.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MR in the Financial Services space:

Q: What are the top financial services pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
