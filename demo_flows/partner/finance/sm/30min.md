Hey there! Thanks for joining us today for this demo. We're excited to dive into how Cisco Meraki's SM solution can benefit the financial services sector. Before we get started, could you share what trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this space?

Great, let's jump right in. In the financial services sector, network security and compliance are always top of mind. With Meraki SM, you can ensure secure access for employees and clients while maintaining compliance standards. Let's take a look at a couple of use cases specific to this sector.

**Use Case 1: Branch Office Connectivity**
Imagine you're managing multiple branch locations for a financial institution. With Meraki, you can easily deploy and manage secure VPN connections between branches using the Dashboard. **Click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-Site VPN'** to see how simple it is to set up.

**Use Case 2: Guest WiFi for Banking**
Providing secure guest WiFi access is crucial for banks and financial institutions. With Meraki, you can create a separate guest network with custom splash pages and access policies. **Click 'Wireless > SSIDs > Add a new SSID'** to see how easy it is to set up a guest network.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning SM in the financial services space:

Q: What are the top financial services pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
