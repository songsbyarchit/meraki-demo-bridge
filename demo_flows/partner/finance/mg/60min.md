Before we get started, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's jump into the demo. Imagine you're pitching Meraki MG to a financial institution looking to streamline their network operations.

Let's walk through a few key use cases:
1. **Monitoring network performance**: Click on **'Monitor > Performance'** to see real-time data on network traffic and application usage.
2. **Ensuring compliance**: Navigate to **'Security > Content filtering'** to set up policies that align with industry regulations.
3. **Remote site management**: Click on **'Wireless > Access points'** to configure and monitor remote branch locations from a single interface.
4. **Guest Wi-Fi access**: Set up a secure guest network by clicking on **'Wireless > SSIDs'** and configuring a guest access policy.
