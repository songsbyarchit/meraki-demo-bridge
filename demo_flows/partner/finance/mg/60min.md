[Pain Points]

Let's start by discussing some pain points that customers in the Finance sector typically care about. Security is a top concern for financial institutions, as they handle sensitive data and need to comply with strict regulations. Additionally, they often have dispersed locations that need to be connected seamlessly. Another pain point is the need for reliable and high-performance networking to support critical applications and services.
