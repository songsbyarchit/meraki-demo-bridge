Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MG can revolutionize network management in the Financial Services sector. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you about any trends or challenges you're noticing with customers in this space. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in the Financial Services sector?

Great insights, thank you! Now, let's explore how Meraki's MG can address these pain points. Imagine a scenario where a financial institution is struggling with network visibility across multiple branches. With Meraki's Dashboard as the central platform, **click 'Network-wide > Clients'** to see real-time data on all connected devices. This level of visibility enables quick troubleshooting and unified management across all sites.

Another common challenge in the Financial Services sector is ensuring network security and compliance. By **clicking 'Security > Content filtering'**, you can easily set up policies to restrict access to non-business websites, ensuring compliance with industry regulations. The simplicity of managing security policies through the Meraki Dashboard saves time and reduces the risk of breaches.

Lastly, let's consider the need for fast and seamless deployment in a constantly evolving industry. **Click 'Configure > Templates'** to create a standardized configuration that can be easily applied to new branches, streamlining the deployment process. This level of automation ensures consistency and reduces the potential for human error during setup.

Now, as you prepare to pitch Meraki MG to customers in the Financial Services sector, here are some common questions you might encounter:

Q: What are the top financial services pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MG during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
