[Opening]

Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MS demo specifically tailored for the Finance sector. I'm excited to show you how Meraki can address the pain points your customers care about and help you pitch to them effectively.

[Pain Points]

In the Finance sector, customers are often concerned about network security, reliability, and ease of management. They need a solution that can ensure their sensitive data is protected, their network is always up and running, and that can be easily managed by their IT teams.

[Positioning Meraki]

Meraki is a cloud-managed networking solution that offers a secure, reliable, and easy-to-manage network infrastructure. With Meraki, customers can have peace of mind knowing that their network is protected by advanced security features, such as encrypted communication and integrated firewall capabilities. Its intuitive dashboard allows for easy monitoring and management, reducing the burden on IT teams and ensuring maximum uptime.

[Use Case 1: Network Segmentation]

Let's take a look at a common use case in the Finance sector - network segmentation. This is crucial for separating different departments or user groups to enhance security and compliance. With Meraki, you can easily create VLANs and segment your network by **clicking 'Configure > Switch ports'**. This allows you to control access to sensitive financial data and prevent unauthorized users from gaining access.

[Use Case 2: Remote Access]

Another important use case for the Finance sector is remote access. With more employees working remotely or on-the-go, it's essential to provide secure access to the network from anywhere. Meraki offers VPN capabilities that allow employees to securely connect to the network from any location, ensuring they can access the resources they need while maintaining security standards.

[Smart Questions]

Now, when pitching Meraki to your customers, here are a few smart questions you can ask to prompt discussion:

1. How do you currently manage network security within your organization, and are there any pain points you're experiencing?
2. What are your top priorities when it comes to network management and security, and how do you see Meraki fitting into those priorities?
3. How important is ease of management and scalability for your organization, and how do you think Meraki can help address those needs?
