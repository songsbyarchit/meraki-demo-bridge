Hey there, thanks for joining us today! I'm excited to show you how Cisco Meraki's MS switches can revolutionize the network infrastructure for financial services. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's explore how Meraki can address these pain points. Imagine a scenario where a financial services firm needs to secure their network while ensuring seamless operations. With Meraki's MS switches, you can easily segment traffic to meet compliance requirements. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Addressing'** to see how VLANs can be quickly set up for different departments. This simplifies network management and enhances security, all from the Meraki Dashboard.

In another use case, consider a bank with multiple branches struggling to maintain consistent network policies across locations. With Meraki's centralized dashboard, **click 'Configure > Templates'** to create and apply configurations universally. This reduces manual errors and streamlines operations, saving time and resources.

Now, let's address some common questions partners may have when pitching Meraki MS in the financial services sector:

Q: What are the top financial services pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MS during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
