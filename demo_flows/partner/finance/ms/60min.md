Good morning/afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MS demo, tailored specifically for the Finance sector. As partners, we understand the unique challenges and requirements that financial institutions face when it comes to their network infrastructure. Today, we'll show you how Meraki MS can address those pain points and help you pitch to your customers effectively.

[Pain Points]
Let's start by addressing some common pain points that finance sector customers care about. Security is always a top concern, especially with sensitive financial data being transmitted over the network. Reliability and uptime are crucial as any downtime can result in significant financial losses. Scalability is also important, as finance companies often need to quickly expand their network as they grow. Lastly, ease of management is key as IT teams in finance companies are often stretched thin and need a solution that is intuitive and easy to use.

[Use Case 1: Security]
One of the key features of Meraki MS is its built-in security capabilities. With Meraki, you can easily set up VLANs to segment network traffic and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive financial data. Let's **click 'Configure > VLANs'** to see how easy it is to set up and manage VLANs using the Meraki dashboard.

[Use Case 2: Reliability]
For finance companies, network downtime is not an option. With Meraki MS, you can set up redundant links and failover configurations to ensure high availability. Let's **click 'Configure > Uplink configuration'** to see how you can set up redundant links in just a few clicks.

[Use Case 3: Scalability]
As finance companies grow, they need a network infrastructure that can scale with them. With Meraki MS, adding new switches to your network is as simple as **click 'Switches > Add a switch'**. The switches automatically configure themselves and join the network seamlessly, making expansion a breeze.

[Use Case 4: Ease of Management]
Managing a network can be a complex task, especially for finance companies with limited IT resources.

Let's **click 'Monitor > Overview'** to see how you can get real-time insights into your network performance.
