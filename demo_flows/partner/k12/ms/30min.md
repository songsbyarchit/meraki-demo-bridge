Hey there, thanks for joining us today! I'm excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki, specifically our MS product, and how it can benefit K-12 Education/Primary Education customers. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you - what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, thanks for sharing that. Let's jump into the demo. Imagine you're working with a K-12 school looking to upgrade their network. With Meraki MS, you can offer them centralized management, visibility, and easy troubleshooting. Let's start by logging into the Meraki Dashboard.

**Click 'Login' and enter your credentials to access the Meraki Dashboard.**

Once you're in, you'll see all your Meraki devices in one place. This is the beauty of the single pane of glass view - no more jumping between different interfaces to manage switches, access points, and security appliances. Let's take a look at a specific use case in a school setting: setting up VLANs for different classrooms.

**Click 'Configure > Switch > Switch Ports' to start setting up VLANs for different classrooms.**

Now, you can easily segment the network for different grades or departments, ensuring proper security and access control. This level of granular control is crucial in an educational environment where data protection and content filtering are top priorities.

Another key benefit of Meraki MS is the ability to troubleshoot network issues quickly. Let's say a teacher in a classroom is experiencing slow internet speeds. With the Meraki Dashboard, you can easily identify the bottleneck and take action to resolve it.

**Click on the specific switch port experiencing issues and run a speed test to diagnose the problem.**

By having this level of visibility and control, you can ensure a seamless learning experience for both students and teachers. Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when pitching Meraki MS to K-12 Education customers:

Q: What are the top K-12 Education/Primary Education pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MS during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining the demo today. I hope you can see the value Meraki MS brings to K-12 Education customers. If you have any more questions or want to discuss further, feel free to reach out.
