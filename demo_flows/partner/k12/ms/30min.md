Presenter: Hi everyone, thank you for joining us for this Meraki MS demo tailored for the K12 sector. Today, we'll be exploring how Meraki can address the pain points that educational institutions face and how you can position Meraki to your customers effectively. 

Let's start by discussing some common pain points in the K12 sector. Schools often struggle with managing a large number of devices on their network, ensuring network security, and providing reliable connectivity for both students and staff. Meraki's cloud-managed networking solutions can help alleviate these challenges by providing centralized management, robust security features, and seamless connectivity.

Now, let's dive into a few use cases that demonstrate the capabilities of Meraki MS in a K12 environment.

Use Case 1: Network Management
Imagine a school with hundreds of devices connected to its network. With Meraki MS, partners can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to easily manage and monitor all network devices from a single dashboard. This simplifies network troubleshooting and ensures a smooth and efficient network operation.

Use Case 2: Security
Security is a top priority for educational institutions. With Meraki MS, partners can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'** to set up content filtering policies to protect students from accessing inappropriate websites. Additionally, partners can **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Firewall'** to configure firewall rules to secure the network from cyber threats.

Use Case 3: Remote Learning
In today's remote learning environment, it's crucial for schools to provide reliable connectivity to students and teachers. Meraki MS offers seamless integration with Meraki's wireless access points, allowing partners to **click 'Wireless > Wireless Access Points'** to provide high-speed wireless connectivity for remote learning initiatives.

Now, let's discuss how to position Meraki to your customers. When pitching Meraki to educational institutions, emphasize the ease of use, centralized management, and robust security features that Meraki offers. Highlight how Meraki can streamline network operations, enhance security, and support remote learning initiatives, ultimately improving the overall learning experience for students and teachers.

To prompt discussion with your customers, here are two smart questions you can ask:
1. How are you currently managing your network devices and ensuring network security in your school?
2. What challenges have you faced in providing reliable connectivity for remote learning, and how do you envision addressing them in the future?
