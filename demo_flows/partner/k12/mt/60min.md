Great insights! Now, let's jump into the demo. Imagine you're pitching Meraki to a school looking to upgrade their network infrastructure. Here are some key pain points customers care about in the education sector and how Meraki can address them:

1. **Network Visibility and Control**  
Let's start by **clicking on 'Network-wide > Monitor > Clients'** in the Meraki Dashboard. Here, you can see real-time insights into all the devices connected to the network. This visibility allows IT admins to quickly identify and troubleshoot any connectivity issues, ensuring a seamless learning experience for students.

2. **Simplified Troubleshooting**  
Next, **click 'Wireless > Access Points'** to view the status of all access points across different school buildings. With Meraki, IT teams can easily pinpoint and resolve connectivity issues remotely, reducing downtime and keeping the network running smoothly.

3. **Unified Management of Multiple Sites**  
Now, let's **navigate to 'Organization > Inventory'** in the Dashboard. Here, you can manage all network devices across multiple school locations from a single pane of glass. This unified management simplifies network administration, saving time and resources for IT staff.

4. **Content Filtering and Security**  
By **selecting 'Security & SD-WAN > Content Filtering'**, you can set up custom filtering policies to ensure a safe online environment for students. Meraki's built-in security features help schools comply with regulations and protect sensitive data from cyber threats.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might encounter when positioning Meraki in the K-12 Education/Primary Education space:

Q: What are the top K-12 education/primary education pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MT during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining us today! We hope this demo has given you valuable insights into how Meraki can enhance network infrastructure in the education sector. Let us know if you have any more questions or need further information. Happy pitching!
