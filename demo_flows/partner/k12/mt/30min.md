Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I know you're a partner reseller focused on the K-12 Education sector, and our goal today is to help you pitch Cisco Meraki's MT solution to customers in this space.

To kick things off, I'd love to hear from you about any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in the K-12 Education sector. What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions here?

Great, thanks for sharing that. Now, let's dive into the demo.

**Use Case 1: Network Visibility**
Let's start by taking a look at the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Network-wide > Overview'**. Here, you can see all your network devices in a single pane of glass, giving you complete visibility into your network health and performance.

**Use Case 2: Simplified Troubleshooting**
Next, let's troubleshoot an issue together. **Click 'Monitor > Clients'**. From here, you can easily identify any clients experiencing connectivity issues and take quick action to resolve them, all from one centralized platform.

**Use Case 3: Unified Management**
Lastly, let's explore how Meraki simplifies network management. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'**. Here, you can easily configure and monitor switch ports across all your sites, ensuring consistent network policies and settings.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have:

Q: What are the top pain points this addresses in the K-12 Education sector?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MT during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

That's a wrap for today's demo. I hope this helps you feel more confident in pitching Meraki MT to K-12 Education customers. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional support.
