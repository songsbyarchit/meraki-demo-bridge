[Opening]
Hello and welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a demo of Meraki MT, specifically tailored for the K12 sector. As partners, it's important to understand the pain points our customers face in this industry and how Meraki can address them. Let's get started!

[Pain Points]
In the K12 sector, network reliability and security are top priorities. Schools need a network that can handle a large number of devices, support seamless collaboration between teachers and students, and ensure student data is protected at all times. Additionally, with limited IT resources, schools need a solution that is easy to manage and maintain.

[Use Case 1: Classroom Connectivity]
Imagine a classroom full of students using their devices for online assignments and research. With Meraki MT, partners can **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to prioritize bandwidth for educational applications, ensuring a smooth online learning experience for students. The intuitive dashboard allows for easy monitoring of network usage and performance, giving teachers peace of mind.

[Use Case 2: Guest Network Management]
School events often require guest access to the network, which can be a security concern. With Meraki MT, partners can **click 'Configure > Guest access** to set up a separate guest network with limited access and bandwidth. This not only ensures network security but also provides a seamless experience for visitors without impacting the main network.

[Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting]
In a school setting, IT issues need to be resolved quickly to minimize disruption to teaching and learning. With Meraki MT, partners can **click 'Tools > Live tools'** to remotely troubleshoot network issues in real-time. This feature allows for faster resolution of problems, reducing downtime and keeping the network running smoothly.

[Smart Questions]
To prompt discussion with attendees, here are a few smart questions to consider:
1. How do you currently prioritize bandwidth for different applications in your school network?
2. What challenges do you face when managing guest access to your network during school events?
3. How do you currently handle remote troubleshooting of network issues in your school environment?
