Hey there! Thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to talk to you about Cisco Meraki and how we can help address the unique challenges faced by K-12 Education/Primary Education customers. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? And what do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's get started. Imagine you're working with a K-12 school district that needs to manage multiple sites and ensure a safe and secure network for students and staff. With Meraki MX, we can address these pain points head-on.

Let's take a look at the Meraki Dashboard now. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Appliance status'**. Here, you can see all your MX appliances across different locations in a single view. This visibility is crucial for troubleshooting and ensuring network uptime.

Now, let's explore a specific use case. **Click 'Networking > SD-WAN & traffic shaping'**. In a school setting, you can prioritize educational applications over non-essential traffic, ensuring a smooth online learning experience for students.

Another key feature for K-12 Education is content filtering. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'**. With Meraki MX, you can easily block inappropriate websites and ensure a safe browsing environment for students.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have:

Q: What are the top K-12 Education/Primary Education pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MX during the pitch?
A: Emphasize Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for exploring Meraki MX with me today. I hope you feel more confident in pitching to K-12 Education customers. Let me know if you have any more questions!
