Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. I know you're a partner reseller focused on K-12 Education/Primary Education, and we're here to help you pitch Cisco Meraki MX to your customers. Before we dive in, can you share any trends or challenges you're seeing with customers in this sector?

Great, let's get started. The K-12 Education sector often struggles with network visibility, troubleshooting, and managing multiple sites. With Meraki MX, we can address these pain points head-on. Let's take a look at some specific use cases.

1. **Remote Learning Support**: With more students learning from home, Meraki MX ensures secure connectivity and content filtering to protect students.
2. **Guest Wi-Fi for Events**: Easily set up temporary networks for school events or open houses without compromising security.
3. **Content Filtering**: Keep students safe online by blocking inappropriate content and ensuring compliance with regulations.
4. **Centralized Management**: Manage all your sites from one dashboard, making it easy to troubleshoot and deploy new configurations.

Now, let's dive into the Meraki Dashboard and see how it simplifies network management. **Click 'Security & SD-WAN > Addressing & VLANs'** to set up VLANs for different student groups. **Click 'Monitor > Appliance status'** to quickly check the health of your MX devices.

When positioning Meraki MX, focus on its ease of use, centralized management, and fast deployment. Partners often ask about the top pain points it addresses, which are usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites. Emphasize these points during your pitch.

Remember, installation is typically plug-and-play, but ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready to go. This will streamline the deployment process for your customers.

That's it for our demo today. Thanks for joining us, and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions about pitching Meraki MX in the K-12 Education sector.
