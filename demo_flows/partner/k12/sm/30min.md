Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. I'm excited to dive into a demo of Cisco Meraki's SM solution with you, especially tailored for the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector. Before we get started, I'd love to hear from you: what trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, now let's jump in and explore how Meraki SM can address some of these pain points for K-12 Education/Primary Education customers.

**Use Case 1: Secure Student Devices**
Imagine being able to easily manage and secure hundreds of student devices across multiple school locations from a single dashboard. With Meraki SM, you can enforce security policies, push out updates, and track device usage in real-time. Let's take a look at how you can do this on the Meraki Dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Monitor > Devices'**.

**Use Case 2: Streamlined Content Filtering**
One of the biggest challenges for K-12 Education/Primary Education is ensuring students have safe access to online resources. Meraki SM allows you to set up content filtering policies based on user groups, ensuring students can only access appropriate content. Let's see how you can set this up on the Dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Configure > Content Filtering'**.

**Use Case 3: Remote Troubleshooting**
When an issue arises with a student device, IT admins need to be able to troubleshoot quickly and efficiently. Meraki SM provides remote troubleshooting tools that allow you to diagnose and resolve issues without needing to be physically present. Let's walk through how you can do this on the Dashboard. **Click 'Systems Manager > Troubleshooting > Remote Desktop'**.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning Meraki SM in the K-12 Education/Primary Education space:

Q: What are the top K-12 Education/Primary Education pain points this addresses?  
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position SM during the pitch?  
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?  
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
