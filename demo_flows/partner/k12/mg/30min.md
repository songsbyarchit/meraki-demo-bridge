Hey there, thanks for joining me today! I'm excited to walk you through a demo of Cisco Meraki's MG product tailored specifically for the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector. Before we dive in, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the challenges you're facing with customers in this space. What trends or unique aspects do you find when positioning solutions here?

Great, let's get started with a quick overview of the Meraki Dashboard. This single pane of glass provides visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management across all your sites. **Click 'Dashboard'** to see it in action.

Now, let's explore a use case tailored for K-12 Education/Primary Education. Imagine a school district with multiple campuses spread out across the region. With Meraki MG, you can easily manage all these sites from one central location. **Navigate to 'Networks > Sites'** to see how easy it is to monitor and control each location.

Another key use case is ensuring a safe and secure online environment for students. With MG's built-in security features, you can easily set up content filtering and application control to protect students from harmful content. **Navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Content filtering'** to see how simple it is to configure these settings.

Let's wrap up with another common scenario in education - bandwidth management. Schools often struggle with limited bandwidth and the need to prioritize traffic for critical applications. With Meraki MG, you can easily set up traffic shaping rules to ensure important applications always have the necessary bandwidth. **Click 'Configure > Traffic shaping'** to see how this works.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning MG in the K-12 Education/Primary Education space:

Q: What are the top pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MG during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.

Thanks for joining me today! I hope this demo has given you a clear understanding of how Meraki MG can address the unique needs of the K-12 Education/Primary Education sector. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to explore more features.
