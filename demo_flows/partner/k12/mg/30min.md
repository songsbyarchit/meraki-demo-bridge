[Start of Demo]

Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this Meraki MG demo targeted towards the K12 sector. I'm excited to show you how Meraki can help address some of the pain points that schools face when it comes to managing their network infrastructure.

Let's start by addressing some common pain points that K12 customers care about. 

First, many schools struggle with limited IT resources and budget constraints. This often leads to network downtime and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, managing a network spread across multiple buildings and campuses can be challenging and time-consuming.

This is where Meraki comes in. Meraki offers a cloud-managed solution that is easy to deploy and manage, even for organizations with limited IT expertise. The centralized dashboard provides a unified view of the entire network, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

Now, let's dive into a couple of use cases to demonstrate how Meraki can address these pain points.

Use Case 1: Simplified Network Management
Imagine you're an IT administrator at a K12 school with multiple buildings. With Meraki, you can easily configure and monitor all your devices from a single dashboard. **Click 'Configure > Switch ports'** to see how you can quickly set up VLANs and access controls across all your switches.

Use Case 2: Enhanced Security
Security is a top priority for schools, especially when it comes to protecting sensitive student data. With Meraki, you can easily enforce security policies and monitor network activity to detect and prevent potential threats. **Click 'Security > Threat Protection'** to see how you can set up firewall rules and intrusion detection to keep your network secure.

Now, let's wrap up with a couple of smart questions you can use to engage your customers during the pitch:

1. How are you currently managing your network infrastructure, and what challenges have you faced?
2. What security measures do you have in place to protect your students' data and ensure network reliability?

Thank you for joining me for this demo. I hope you found it helpful in understanding how Meraki can help address the unique needs of K12 schools. If you have any further questions or would like to explore a customized solution for your organization, please feel free to reach out to us.
