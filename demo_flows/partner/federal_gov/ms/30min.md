Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today for this Meraki MS demo tailored for the Federal Gov sector. As partners, we understand the unique challenges and pain points that government customers face when it comes to network management and security. Today, we're going to show you how Meraki can address these issues and help you pitch to your customers effectively.

Let's start by addressing some common pain points that government customers care about. Security is a top priority for them, especially with the increasing number of cyber threats targeting sensitive government data. They also need a network solution that is easy to manage and scalable to meet their evolving needs. Lastly, they require a solution that is compliant with government regulations and standards.

Now, let's dive into a few use cases to demonstrate how Meraki can help address these pain points. 

Use Case 1: Network Security
One of the key features of Meraki MS is its integrated security capabilities. With Meraki, government customers can easily set up firewall rules, segment their network, and monitor traffic in real-time. Let's **click 'Configure > Security & SD-WAN'** to show you how simple it is to set up firewall rules and implement security policies.

Use Case 2: Network Management
Government agencies often struggle with managing their network infrastructure, especially if they have multiple locations. Meraki's cloud-based dashboard allows them to centrally manage and monitor all their network devices from a single interface. Let's **click 'Dashboard > Network-wide > Monitor > Switches'** to show you how easy it is to monitor the health of your network and troubleshoot any issues.

Use Case 3: Compliance
Government customers need to comply with various regulations and standards to ensure the security and integrity of their network. Meraki MS is designed to meet these requirements, with features like secure access controls, encryption, and regular firmware updates. Let's **click 'Configure > Access control > 802.1X'** to show you how you can easily set up secure access controls for your network.

Now, as you pitch Meraki to your government customers, here are a few smart questions you can ask to prompt discussion:

1. How are you currently managing and securing your network infrastructure across multiple locations?
2. What are the biggest challenges you face in ensuring compliance with government regulations and standards?
3. How important is scalability and flexibility in your network solution to accommodate future growth and changes?
