Hey there! Thanks for joining us today. I know we have a lot of partners in the Federal Government sector, so I'm excited to dive into how Cisco Meraki MR can help address some of the unique challenges in this space. Before we get started, I'd love to hear from you: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?

Great, let's jump in and explore how Meraki MR can make a difference for Federal Government customers. 

**Use Case 1: Seamless Connectivity**
Let's start by **clicking 'Wireless > Access Points'** on the dashboard. Here, you can see how easy it is to deploy and manage multiple access points across different locations, ensuring seamless connectivity for government employees and visitors.

**Use Case 2: Network Security**
Next, **navigate to 'Security & SD-WAN > Addressing'**. Meraki's built-in security features help protect sensitive government data and networks from cyber threats, providing peace of mind for IT administrators.

**Use Case 3: Centralized Management**
Now, **click 'Monitor > Clients'** to see how the Meraki Dashboard offers a single pane of glass view of the entire network, enabling unified management and streamlined troubleshooting for IT teams in Federal Government agencies.

**Use Case 4: Scalability**
Let's explore scalability by **navigating to 'Configure > Wireless settings'**. Meraki MR allows for easy expansion as government agencies grow or need to accommodate temporary offices or events, making it a flexible solution for changing needs.

Now, let's address some common questions partners might have when positioning Meraki MR in the Federal Government space:

Q: What are the top federal government pain points this addresses?
A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

Q: How do we best position MR during the pitch?
A: Emphasise Meraki’s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?
A: It’s typically plug-and-play, but partners should ensure licensing is pre-applied and templates are ready.
