[Pain Points]

Government customers often face challenges with managing and securing their network infrastructure, especially when it comes to remote locations or branch offices. They need a solution that is easy to deploy, manage, and monitor, while also providing high levels of security and reliability.

Meraki MG is the perfect solution for government customers as it offers cloud-managed networking that is simple, secure, and scalable. With centralized management through the Meraki dashboard, government agencies can easily deploy and configure their network infrastructure, monitor performance in real-time, and ensure compliance with security policies.

[Use Case 1: Remote Office Deployment]

Let's start with a common use case for government agencies - deploying network infrastructure in remote offices. With Meraki MG, partners can easily set up and configure MG devices at various remote locations using the Meraki dashboard. **click 'Configure > Switch ports'** This allows for centralized management and visibility into the entire network, even for remote locations with limited IT staff.

[Use Case 2: Secure VPN Connectivity]

Another key use case for government customers is secure VPN connectivity. Meraki MG offers built-in VPN capabilities that allow agencies to securely connect remote offices or mobile users to the main network. **click 'Security & SD-WAN > Site-to-Site VPN'** This ensures that sensitive government data is transmitted securely over the network, maintaining compliance with security regulations.

[Smart Questions]

To prompt discussion with the attendee, here are two smart questions you can ask during your pitch:

1. How does your current network infrastructure handle the challenges of remote office deployment and secure connectivity?
2. What are the key security requirements that your agency needs to meet, and how do you currently address them?

[Closing]

In conclusion, Meraki MG offers a simple, secure, and scalable solution for government customers that addresses their pain points and provides a reliable network infrastructure.
