    Q: How does this solution reduce IT workload in our {vertical_label.lower()} environment?  
    A: Meraki simplifies management through one dashboard and automates many tasks like updates and troubleshooting.

    Q: What kind of ROI or cost reduction can we expect?  
    A: Customers often report major time savings and reduced downtime, especially for remote sites.

    Q: Can we integrate this with our existing systems and security policies?  
    A: Yes â€” Meraki supports APIs, SAML, and integration with existing firewalls, Active Directory, and SIEM tools.""",

    A: Usually lack of visibility, slow troubleshooting, and complexity managing multiple sites.

    Q: How do we best position {product.upper()} during the pitch?  
    A: Emphasise Merakiâ€™s ease of use, single dashboard, and fast deployment with built-in security.

    Q: What installation or deployment concerns should we be ready for?

    A: Cost vs legacy vendors, and skepticism over cloud-managed security â€” arm them with TCO comparisons.

    Q: What enablement do we provide for partners?  
    A: Access to demo kits, dashboards, playbooks, and partner-exclusive webinars.

    Q: How do we support onboarding post-sale?  
    A: We offer co-delivery workshops, pre-built config templates, and Meraki support handles escalations fast."""

You are building a {length} demo script for Cisco Meraki.

Product: **{product.upper()}**  
Audience: **{audience.title()}**  
Sector: **{vertical_label}**

{persona_instructions}

Start with a short, friendly intro that reminds the presenter of:
- Who they are speaking to (e.g. partner reseller, customer IT admin, or internal SE)
- What the purpose of this demo is
- 1â€“2 warm-up questions tailored to the audience type:
    - For partners: What trends or challenges are you seeing with customers in this sector? What do you find unique or tricky about positioning solutions in this space?
    - For customers: What does your current network setup look like? Where are your biggest IT headaches today?
    - For internal: What common questions do our customers ask in the {vertical_label} sector? What objections or misconceptions do we frequently encounter?

Your script should:
- Focus on the specific needs of the **{vertical_label}** sector
- Include {time_scope} strong, specific use cases
- Use natural, spoken-style language â€” not formal marketing text
- Highlight the Meraki Dashboard as the central platform (single pane of glass)
- Emphasise how this enables visibility, simplified troubleshooting, and unified management
- Include at least {'2â€“3' if length == '30min' else '4â€“6'} UI interactions where the presenter would click or navigate the dashboard
- Format all UI actions with bold syntax (e.g., **click 'Configure > Switch ports'**)
