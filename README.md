This tool helps Cisco teams run demo sessions inside Webex chats. It simplifies the process. Instead of switching tabs or scrambling for pitch decks, you can run a flow directly in conversation.

The bot shows users a set of cards. First, they choose an audience, a vertical, and a product line. Then, they pick how long they have for the demo. Based on those choices, it returns a script.

Everything happens inside Webex. No extra tabs, no wasted time.

It's simple to use, and it's easy to test. You can extend it later if needed. Right now, it keeps the focus on speed, relevance, and delivery.
