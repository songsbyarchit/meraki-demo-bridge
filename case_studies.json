    "text": "What makes the perfect shopping experience? Is it the quality of the customer service? The temperature of the space? The selection of the clothing and sizes?\nIn a world where online shopping often wins, brick-and-mortar retail is feeling the pressure to answer yes to not just a few but all of these questions to incentivize shoppers to walk through their doors and make a purchase.\nDanish retail chain SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E, known for its high-quality clothing, is also quickly becoming known for checking off the expectations and needs of an exceptional shopping experience.\nWith 60+ store locations, alongside an ample online presence, they are modernizing the shopping experience through innovative uses of technology, both behind the scenes and in the store. By incorporating AI insights with smart cameras to understand customer behavior, demographics, and preferences, and using MT sensors to maintain an optimal in-store environment, SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E ensures that each aspect of the physical retail experience is curated to perfection with the help of Meraki network, security, and IoT solutions.\nIt goes without saying that the retail shopping environment plays a pivotal role in customer engagement and sales. It also goes hand in hand that a brand must truly understand their target audience to curate the most appealing experience and drive sales to that customer.\nSAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E was noticing a discrepancy in their sales conversion rates\u2014there was no problem with foot traffic but the total number of sales based on the number of potential customers was not matching up. With a substantial amount of their business being in-store, it was essential that they start learning more about the customers who were coming through their doors each day. They needed to find a reliable, secure way to collect customer data in their physical locations without increasing bandwidth.\nThe challenge was multifaceted; not only did SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E need to understand who was entering their stores in terms of demographic data, such as age, gender, and even mood, but they also needed to understand how the in-store environment, like temperature, was affecting customer behavior. Were customers leaving because the store was too hot or too cold, affecting their willingness to browse and try on clothes? Were they not finding the right style or selection on the store floor? How could the store environment be optimized to encourage more sales?\nOne of the challenges we had was that our sale conversion rates didn\u2019t match. There were multiple reasons for that, from the hardware that we\u2019ve chosen in the past to the infrastructure behind it and the lack of partnership with our previous vendors\u2014then enter Cisco Meraki.\nHead of Information Technology Operations & Infrastructure, SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E\nTo address these challenges, SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E had to look beyond traditional retail metrics and harness innovative technologies that could provide deeper insights and facilitate a more nuanced understanding of their customers, while also providing a stable network to maintain it all.\n\u201cIn order to be able to run a successful retail business your network and your infrastructure is your key,\u201d says Simeon Solarsky, Head of Information Technology Operations & Infrastructure at SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E. \u201cEverything these days is network connected in one way or another, be it warehouse scanners, POS solutions, phones, iPads, and everything else. The network for us is at the center. If there isn\u2019t a solid, reliable network, then we don\u2019t have business.\u201d\nHaving previously worked with Cisco solutions, Simeon was confident that the Meraki network would provide the foundational backbone for their brand\u2019s connection. But he needed to explore beyond just a network solution to gain customer insights and actionable data, while also making sure the new data was secure.\nSimeon and his team chose a comprehensive Meraki suite, including Meraki MV smart cameras and MT sensors paired with MX security and SD-WAN solutions. To harness powerful customer analytics, they brought in EVERYANGLE, an ecosystem partner offering seamless integration with the cameras.\nThe MV smart cameras serve a dual purpose for SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E. Not only do they work with EVERYANGLE to provide the needed customer analytics and data, but they also ensure the physical security of the store. This allowed for a consolidation of vendors and streamlining of operations, as all the solutions could be managed through the single Meraki dashboard.\nThe integration of Meraki MX security and SD-WAN ensures the stability and bandwidth needed for the Meraki MV cameras and MT sensors as well as the secure data transmission across the network, which was crucial for maintaining customer privacy and trust. This advanced network solution empowered SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E to leverage the full potential of their smart devices and analytics, leading to the impressive insights and results they achieved in their flagship store and beyond.\nOur board and C-suite were really blown away by the Meraki smart cameras and EVERYANGLE solutions. They were like, \u2018When did we do that? What system is that? When can we have it in more stores?\u2019\nHead of Information Technology Operations & Infrastructure, SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E\nLeveraging the capabilities of MV smart cameras and the AI technology from EVERYANGLE, SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E was able to collect valuable data on customer demographics and behavior without adding strain to their network bandwidth. This data was not only about who was visiting their stores but also how they interacted with the space itself.\nThe integration of MV cameras and EVERYANGLE led to significant improvements in SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E\u2019s retail operations. Notably, there was a surprising discovery. When opening their flagship Munich store, it attracted a 50/50 split between male and female customers, contrary to their typical 80% female and 20% male expectation. This insight drove them to adjust their merchandising strategy accordingly, resulting in a 5.5% higher conversion rate for men\u2019s sales within the first quarter. The clarity provided by the data also generated excitement and approval from C-suite executives, who recognized the technology as the missing piece of their retail puzzle and expressed excitement about deploying the technologies in other locations.\nThe deployment of MT indoor air quality sensors further enhanced the shopping environment by maintaining an ideal temperature of 22\u00b0C, known to foster optimal customer engagement. These sensors, using MV cameras as a gateway, allowed for the precise monitoring and adjustment of the store climate, creating a more inviting atmosphere that encouraged customers to stay longer and interact more with the merchandise.\nCentral to their success was the Meraki dashboard, which presented a cloud-managed solution enabling SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E to act quickly and remotely. Store managers can now make immediate adjustments based on real-time data, and the leadership team could view historical trends to plan for seasonal changes or marketing strategies. The Meraki dashboard is the glue that brings the data of the network and devices together in one central cloud dashboard, providing a proactive, simplified approach to retail management.\nThrough a seamless blend of ambience, personalization, and data-driven strategy, SAMS\u00d8E SAMS\u00d8E is not just surviving the retail evolution\u2014they are thriving in it through digital innovation. They are proving that the perfect shopping experience is about harmonizing the tangible with the technological, the aesthetic with the analytical, and the traditional with the transformative."

    "text": "\nPurdue University is a U.S. public institution of higher education that serves more than 70,000 undergraduate and graduate students across three campuses in Indiana, plus 30,000 additional students in remote locations and online across the globe. Purdue has been credited as one of the top ten most-recognized institutions in the world. Contributing to its renown, no doubt, is that the university has not raised tuition costs in 13 years.\nPurdue was also recognized as one the Top 50 Most Innovative Companies in the world (in sixteenth place) by Fast Company for the university\u2019s work in the semiconductors field. Purdue was the only university to make this prestigious list. Despite the innovations coming out of its labs and classrooms, the technologies that powered Purdue\u2019s campus IT infrastructure were not quite as advanced. Campus Wi-Fi experienced frequent performance and reliability issues that often didn\u2019t meet the expectations of students, faculty, and staff.\nThis network upgrade enabled us to streamline some of our capabilities, reduce the amount of touch time that\u2019s required on the backbone, allowed us to focus on broader objectives, and deliver new capabilities for students, faculty, and staff.\nChief Information Officer and Vice President for Information Technology, Purdue University\nUptime for the university\u2019s campus-wide Wi-Fi network was only about 77%. Older equipment (such as 802.11n access points) meant there wasn\u2019t enough bandwidth to meet the daily demand of about 100,000 unique devices. And issues with the university\u2019s convoluted multi-factor authentication system\u2014supporting roughly 4.6 million logins daily\u2014resulted in 23% of all calls to the help desk.\nConnectivity is a top need for many. For students away at college, it allows them to stay connected to home life, school life, and of course, their schoolwork. \u201cIf they experience any slowness, or they\u2019re unable to access the things they need to do, it\u2019s very frustrating for students,\u201d explained Ian Hyatt, Chief Information Officer and Vice President for Information Technology for Purdue University.\nThis difficulty in providing reliable connectivity meant that Purdue\u2019s IT department was unable to satisfy its mission to \u201csupport teaching and learning, enhance research, and enable faculty and staff to achieve their objectives while providing a positive student experience.\u201d As a result, students, faculty, and staff had diminished expectations of campus connectivity. In fact, students\u2019 frustrations with the Wi-Fi network were so palpable that discussion about it became the top trending topic related to the university on Reddit.\nTo successfully address these issues and deliver on its mission, Purdue\u2019s IT staff sought to shift their way of thinking from \u201cjust keeping the lights on\u201d to a mindset of \u201cdelivering an essential, high-quality service.\u201d This would include a sizeable investment in new equipment and services, as well as updates to operational processes and procedures.\nThe university partnered with Cisco to help execute a five-year deployment plan that would transform and unify Purdue\u2019s networking infrastructure with 12,750 Meraki Wi-Fi 6 and 6E wireless access points across the university\u2019s West Lafayette, Northwest, and Fort Wayne campuses. The project would also streamline Purdue\u2019s deployment of the Cisco Duo multi-factor authentication system to deliver greater security and ease of use, integrate Splash Access for a more robust and intuitive Wi-Fi login and self-management portal, and utilize Splunk for end-to-end network monitoring, increased security, and faster disaster recovery.\nThe first phase of the five-year project focused on overhauling the Wi-Fi experience for the approximately 16,000 students living in residence halls on the West Lafayette campus. To keep things moving swiftly, Purdue performed the deployment during the academic term, while students were actively living in the residence halls\u2014instead of waiting for a break between terms, when most students are away. The students were willing to deal with some disruption to their physical environment for the significant improvements to the Wi-Fi network they anticipated.\nOver a three-month period, Purdue replaced 3,750 access points. In the following months, Purdue deployed an additional 2,600 access points in the West Lafayette campus\u2019s academic spaces and another 725 access points at Purdue Northwest academic spaces and residence halls. \u201cThe journey has been incredible,\u201d stated Hyatt. \u201cCisco provided us with terrific solutions and was able to pivot when there were pandemic-related challenges like supply chain issues and other things.\u201d\nThe journey has been incredible. Cisco provided us with terrific solutions and was able to pivot when there were challenges like supply chain issues and other things.\nChief Information Officer and Vice President for Information Technology, Purdue University\nImprovements were immediately obvious. The Wi-Fi network\u2019s uptime was now over 99%. Network speeds quadrupled. \u201cThe speeds are far beyond anything students ever had in the past at Purdue,\u201d explained Hyatt. Even with each student possessing an average of five connected devices, the network was not oversaturated.\nThe student experience of connecting to the network and managing personal devices was also elevated with the integration of Splash Access. Students could now expect the same level of seamless connectivity\u2014ease of connection, always available, and high-throughput capabilities\u2014that they typically experience at home. With that in mind, Purdue branded the new network portal as \u201cURHOME\u201d (the \u201cUR\u201d standing for \u201cuniversity residence\u201d).\nStudents can now easily connect their multiple devices\u2014such as smart devices, gaming consoles, printers, and media streaming players (and even grant visitors temporary access)\u2014to their own domain space using a single pre-shared access key. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been an amazing transformation that we\u2019ve gone through in the residence halls with the new solutions that have been deployed,\u201d said Hyatt. \u201cIt\u2019s making students\u2019 lives easier with their personal events, activities, gaming, and streaming, all easily accessible now. It\u2019s helping them in their studies and their ability to reach the network for the things they need to be successful.\u201d\nWith the simplification of device onboarding and streamlining of multi-factor authentication using Cisco Duo, Purdue IT was seeing results quickly. For instance, during the Boiler Gold Rush welcome week, support tickets were down over 80% compared to the prior year. The average service desk wait time dropped from 3 minutes and 33 seconds to 1 minute and 7 seconds. \u201cCisco\u2019s security and networking solutions work well together,\u201d said Hyatt. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t create noise or slow things down. It allows things to move at speed in a secure fashion.\u201d\n\u201cTransparency in the network and the environment is a huge win for us because people are able to do what they need to do without having to think about whether or not it\u2019s going to work, whether or not it\u2019s going to be slow, or if it\u2019s going to have a negative effect on their ability to accomplish their objectives,\u201d said Hyatt. \u201cAt the end of the day, a seamless network and a transparent network to them is one that just works. With Cisco, it\u2019s always on, it\u2019s always there, and they can always count on it.\u201d\nThe students were not the only ones to benefit from the recent upgrades; Purdue\u2019s IT team also saw notable improvements to network operations. For instance, by using tools from Meraki and Splunk, the Purdue IT team gained increased visibility across the network and could more easily identify and address problems.\nAnd while Purdue\u2019s IT team chose to manage its new switching and campus wireless infrastructure with the Cisco Catalyst Center on-premises solution, they appreciated that they can later switch to cloud management with the Meraki dashboard when they are ready, without having to purchase any new hardware. \u201cThe automation, machine learning, and other capabilities we can make use of are going to help us reduce our exposure to unwanted network events\u2014such as outages and security risks\u2014and at the same time will give us a much more efficient operation in general terms,\u201d according to Hyatt.\n\u201cAltogether, this all adds up to allowing students, faculty, and staff to be successful in teaching and learning, as well as in the research component that we are a very large part of,\u201d said Hyatt. \u201cIt also gives us the ability to generate at speed new services and capabilities that were not part of our portfolio in the past.\u201d\nWhile Purdue is still in the midst of its five-year deployment plan, the IT team has already accomplished much to be proud of. \u201cThis network upgrade enabled us to streamline some of our capabilities, reduce the amount of touch time that\u2019s required on the backbone, allowed us to focus on broader objectives, and deliver new capabilities for students, faculty, and staff,\u201d stated Hyatt. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly proud of the fact we have vastly improved our network operations, our system operations, and our reliability and resiliency. Our services are operating at historic highs in just the last two years.\u201d"

    "text": "In May 2022, a new commercial building nestled on the banks of the serene Spree River was completed in Berlin, Germany. But this is not a typical corporate edifice. ANH Hausbesitz, the developer and building owner, designed a distinctive structure that complements its surroundings. In a perfect blend of function and form, the building curves in harmony with the river and features cutting-edge technology designed to provide exceptional sustainability, functionality, and convenience.\nIn 2022, the Terrace was just the second building in the world to receive a perfect 100/100 rating from SmartScore (an international global standard for smart buildings) and a subsequent Platinum designation. It was also Gold-certified by WiredScore because of its superior digital infrastructure.\nData is at the heart of any smart building and the Terrace is a leading example. Powered by approximately 500 Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy sensors and ubiquitous Wi-Fi, this allows for many amenities\u2014including elevators, lighting, window blinds, and climate control\u2014to be automated or controlled remotely with a smart phone building control app. Sensors anonymously track tenants\u2019 locations and activities, while protecting privacy. With this data, the app only shows the controls available for the space being occupied. Resources like desks, meeting rooms, and parking spaces can also be booked using the app.\nArchitects like me tend to focus on aesthetics, not the technical components. An important objective for me on this project was to make most of the technology invisible as to not diminish the aesthetics of the building. I needed a partner that could help me do that.\nHead of Smart Building Development, ANH Hausbesitz\nIn addition to its contemporary, award-winning design and focus on sustainability, Jens Waninger, Head of Smart Building Development for ANH Hausbesitz, wanted tenants to enjoy the conveniences of modern technology and ubiquitous connectivity without any visible or obtrusive infrastructure or equipment.\nWith only a small in-house technology team, ANH Hausbesitz also faced the challenge of providing not only a physically secure building, but also a secure network.

    "text": "Founded in 1964, Mike\u2019s Bikes is a highly successful local bike shop with a singular mission: to get as many butts on bikes as possible. Based in Northern California with additional retail stores in the Denver area, the company is committed to promoting the cycling lifestyle in the community. As Mike\u2019s Bikes\u2019 Vice President of Operations, Dylan Rinaldi, says, \u201cit\u2019s fun, healthy, and the cleanest form of transportation.\u201d\nAlong with its staff of 260-plus knowledgeable cycling evangelists, one of the keys to the company\u2019s success has been its ability to offer customers an omnichannel experience by giving them a 360-degree view of what\u2019s available online and in-store. This approach means customers enjoy a superior shopping experience, while enabling Mike\u2019s Bikes to grow its online business at the same pace as its brick-and-mortar retail stores.\nThe impetus for going to digital price tags using Meraki access points and SES-imagotag was a better experience for the customer and a better experience for the employee.\nIT Director, Mike\u2019s Bikes\nMike\u2019s Bikes is constantly on the lookout for ways to make the experience even better for its customers, whether they\u2019re researching bikes on mikesbikes.com, dropping in to one of the company\u2019s 18 retail locations to get expert advice, or maybe taking a test-ride before making a purchase. While the customer experience depends heavily on the company\u2019s outstanding employees, the technology required to support their efforts also has a critical role to play in ensuring customers can get the product information they need and make their purchases quickly and efficiently.\nAs Mike\u2019s Bikes IT Director, Chris O\u2019Dell, says, \u201ctechnology just needs to work every time; the simpler the better. Customers just want to come in and buy something and get out the door quickly.\u201d\nWhen Chris joined the company in 2017, bringing uniformity to the technology stack across its 18 retail locations and two warehouses while improving network reliability were his top priorities. With a mix of different technologies and vendors in the network, daily operations were inefficient and network outages were all too common. Any loss of connectivity had the potential to result in point-of-sale (POS) system outages, keeping paying customers waiting while connectivity was restored.\nAnother operational challenge for frontline staff involved printing price tags for bikes and other products. Whenever there was a price change to support a sale or promotion, employees would have to manually print price tags and attach them to the correct bikes throughout the showroom, a time-consuming process repeated across all of the company\u2019s stores. Printing problems were common and a major source of frustration for employees, one which resulted in many support tickets for the IT team.\nMike\u2019s Bikes deployed cloud-managed Cisco Meraki MR access points for Wi-Fi connectivity in all of its retail and warehouse locations, along with Meraki MX security and SD-WAN appliances to future-proof their network reliability and security.\nSecure, reliable, site-to-site VPN connectivity was also critical for Mike\u2019s Bikes across its retail stores. Meraki MX devices allow the IT team to easily manage this while protecting the network from security threats and ensuring that every payment transaction is successful. In addition, by pairing the Meraki MX with a cellular device, secure backup connectivity is guaranteed in the event of an internet outage.\nTo save costs on implementation and cabling, the company deployed digital price tags from SES-imagotag, which are compatible with Meraki MR access points. This combination provides wireless connectivity for digital tags in a single device without having to deploy separate access points for Wi-Fi and digital tag gateways.\nFinally, Mike\u2019s Bikes is also taking advantage of the Meraki dashboard to dramatically simplify its day-to-day network operations. The integration of Meraki Systems Manager for mobile device management (MDM) in the dashboard was critical for giving the IT team deep visibility and managing the entire stack. It has enabled them to onboard, manage, and secure employee workstations and end-user devices in all of its stores.\nThe simplicity of both the software and the hardware tools that we\u2019ve put into place contributes to our success. Cisco Meraki is what powers the business.\nIT Director, Mike\u2019s Bikes\nSince adopting Meraki technology, Mike\u2019s Bikes has realized significant operational efficiencies that have led to greater agility and improved business performance. By standardizing on the Meraki MR access points and the Meraki MX security and SD-WAN appliances across its 18 retail locations and two distribution warehouses, Mike\u2019s Bikes has significantly improved network uptime, security, and operational efficiency. The Meraki dashboard provides the company\u2019s two-person IT team with end-to-end network visibility, which simplifies day-to-day network maintenance and monitoring.\nAs the company continues to expand over a larger geographical area, the plug-and-play aspect of the Meraki solution is providing important time and cost savings for Mike\u2019s Bikes.\n\u201cThe ability for me to simply send a new Meraki unit out to a remote location,\u201d Chris says, \u201cand not have to go there personally to configure it is very valuable.\u201d\nWith its store-wide rollout of the SES-imagotag platform that integrates with Meraki MR access points, Mike\u2019s Bikes has eliminated the time-consuming and frustrating process of printing thousands of price tags annually. Staff can now focus squarely on the needs of customers in the store. Employees can tap their phone on a digital tag to get inventory levels for a particular bike across all the stores and customers can scan a QR code to go right to the product information on the store\u2019s website.\nWhat\u2019s more, the addition of digital tags gives the company greater flexibility and agility to launch new sales promotions easily and adjust prices in a matter of minutes across all of its stores, and on the website as well. The company estimates that it\u2019s saving about 30,000 sheets of paper annually, a significant achievement that aligns with the company\u2019s sustainability goals.\nBecause the Meraki MR access points communicate with SES-imagotag digital tags out of the box, the company did not need to purchase additional hardware. This resulted in up-front cost savings, and with fewer devices in the network, a reduction in ongoing maintenance and management overhead.\nThe future for Mike\u2019s Bikes is bright. \u201cThe simplicity of both the software and the hardware tools that we\u2019ve put into place contributes to our success,\u201d says Chris. \u201cCisco Meraki is what powers the business.\u201d"

    "text": "\nSmarter building management key to cutting carbon\nThe UK government aims to transition public sector facilities, including schools, to carbon net-zero by 2050\u2014and local authorities are being tagged in to help achieve that goal. These organizations have control over housing, transport, and energy use and can be hugely influential in generating momentum and resetting sustainability expectations.\nLike other local councils across the UK, Wrexham County Borough Council (WCBC) is tasked with meeting ambitious carbon reduction commitments. WCBC itself wants to be carbon neutral by 2030. To do so it must optimize energy use across its estate, enable smart building management, and reduce travel costs by enabling remote management of IT resources.\nWrexham is the fourth-largest city in Wales, with a regional population of 135,000. WCBC manages 70 schools, delivering education for over 20,000 students. This estate currently accounts for 56% of the carbon emissions resulting from the energy usage at all the Council\u2019s buildings, excluding Council houses. A planned upgrade of the schools\u2019 networks provided a valuable and opportune chance to rethink the approach to building management.\nOptimizing energy use across the school estate\nWales has major plans to upgrade its education sector. The country launched an updated national curriculum in September 2022, and is investing in new, digital infrastructure to allow all schools to connect with online platforms. The goal is to enable more mobile and digital learning experiences and for educators to have the flexibility to find innovative approaches to teaching and learning.\nA consistent, reliable network across all schools helps WCBC meet national standards of connectivity and access for students, faculty, and visitors alike. Schools are able to connect to the Welsh government\u2019s national platform, Hwb, which provides easy access to teaching and learning tools such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google Classroom. Individual schools then choose apps or determine device policies that best match local needs.\nMax Wheelock, Climate Change and Carbon Reduction Officer at WCBC, says such infrastructure investments must now adopt a sustainability lens. The carbon reduction team wanted to run a proof of concept at selected primary schools to understand how electricity consumption resulting from the IT network infrastructure could be optimized. WCBC wanted to move away from the \u201calways on\u201d state to reduce unnecessary overnight power usage, costs, and carbon emissions.\nWheelock stated that the Council has made a commitment to decrease carbon emissions from Council buildings annually and to construct low- or zero-carbon buildings.\nThe longer-term goal would be to deploy smart building management systems across the schools\u2019 estate.\nProactive control of the network infrastructure\nThe use of Cisco Meraki products establishes consistent network management throughout WCBC schools. The solution, designed and implemented alongside Cisco partner CAE Technology Services, involved 1,143 Meraki MR Wi-Fi 6 access points and more than 250 Meraki MS switches. Schools can be managed from a central location via the Meraki dashboard application programming interface (API).\nCentral visibility and control allow WCBC to power up or power down switch ports and access points. Using Meraki MS port schedules, WCBC can set recurring time-based activations. Rather than running continuously, a school\u2019s network will now start-up at 7:30 am and switch off at 8:30 pm.\nThe Meraki dashboard API provides access to the school network, allowing centralized visibility, control, and management. As the network is programmatically configured rather than by human touch, there is no configuration drift or inconsistency. Each site is standardized, making support and fixes much easier.\nIn the event of a network issue, the Meraki dashboard allows WCBC\u2019s network service team to drill down to a specific device. The team can be proactive and agile, getting ahead of network issues before they impact the school to avoid unnecessary service journeys.\nThe approach was first assessed and refined in five schools before being rolled out across the region.\nOnce the configuration templates were in place it was simply a matter of putting in the new hardware and stripping out the old. The new network was up and running the next morning, with no downtime for the school. WCBC had 70 schools on the network within just a six-month period.\nThere is potential for greater cumulative carbon and financial savings from extending the technology across all WCBC schools and other corporate buildings. The Meraki and partner engagement has also provided insights into the hourly air quality, noise level, temperature, and humidity in teaching spaces across schools.\nClimate Change and Carbon Reduction Officer, Wrexham County Borough Council\nCutting energy use by 52%\nThe impact is transformational. Today, teachers across Wrexham can deliver lessons from anywhere on the school grounds. A consistent, safe, and reliable network means schools can access the national teaching platforms or choose their own digital tools. WCBC has around 20,000 tablet and laptop devices, including both Apple and Windows OS connecting to the network; each device that connects to the network is identified, registered, and kept secure.\nProgress on sustainability targets is substantial.\nUsing WiserWatts, an integrated energy management platform from Cisco partner CAE Technology Services, it is estimated that there has been a 52% reduction in overnight Wi-Fi electricity use within the school estate, with annual carbon emissions expected to decrease by ten metric tons of CO2e. Additionally, this reduction in energy consumption is projected to result in potential savings of up to \u00a322,000 for fiscal year 2023/2024, based on the current unit cost of electricity.\nOver the lifespan of the hardware, significant cost savings can be achieved by continuing to reduce energy consumption and optimize port utilization. Optimizing the availability of the network can help reduce waste and further enhance cost-efficiency, and Wheelock says this is only the start.\nThere is potential for greater cumulative carbon and financial savings from further extending the technology across WCBC schools and other corporate buildings. The Meraki MT sensors, for example, provide insights into the hourly air quality, noise level, temperature, and humidity in teaching spaces across schools. This has helped to identify when these spaces are over cooled or over heated during operating hours, enabling WCBC to make decisions about how best to control and regulate the temperature. And the WCBC can manage those configurations remotely, eliminating the need to travel across the schools\u2019 estate making manual adjustments.\nIn the future, building management systems may enable WCBC to dynamically adjust heating and cooling across schools throughout the day. The Council is also investigating how sensors added to the Meraki network could monitor a room\u2019s usage and automatically close off unused parts of the school. Lights on community sports fields can be kept on later and switched off automatically\u2014further cutting down on energy costs.\nThe lessons learned across the 70 schools can be applied to the management of other buildings within the Council\u2019s estate as well, and to reiterate Wheelock\u2019s sentiment, this is only the beginning."

    "text": "IOR is a family-owned, integrated supplier of fuels to regional, rural, and remote Australia. Since its humble beginnings as a small oil refinery in the remote town of Eromanga in the Australian outback, IOR has grown to become one of the country\u2019s leading fuel distributors, with the first and largest network of unattended fuel stops and one of the largest hazardous materials transport fleets in Australia.\nWith a diverse product and service offering that includes bulk fuel supply, equipment sales and rentals, fuel management services, and aviation fuel supply and distribution, the company acquired an 81 million liter fuel import terminal on the South Coast in 2020 and built a second 110 million liter facility on the East Coast just three years later, delivering up to an additional 12 days\u2019 capacity to supply the Brisbane market.\nA key pillar of IOR\u2019s business is its extensive national network of 24-hour diesel stops and on-airport aviation refueling facilities. These facilities primarily provide fuel to surrounding communities, the essential long-haul transport industry, and the aviation industry. IOR\u2019s unattended fuel networks currently comprise more than 130 on-road and on-airport sites and extend to the farthest reaches of regional Australia.\nAs the company looked to expand this network to meet the needs of the market, it faced some unique operational and logistical challenges. Its fuel stops are often located many hundreds of miles from each other and from the country\u2019s major population centers, making site visits for troubleshooting network infrastructure costly and often impractical. Unlike many of the company\u2019s competitors, IOR\u2019s stops are also unattended, which means the company depends on having the right mix of technology solutions to manage them remotely. When a customer calls with a fault, the ability to address the issue remotely can save a round trip potentially consisting of hundreds of miles.\nOperating such a remote and geographically disparate network using technology we had access to back in 2005 was never going to allow this business to scale.\nAccording to Elliot Mackenzie, Head of Technology at IOR, the company prides itself on its culture of technology development and innovation, a key contributing factor to its long track record of continuous growth.\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s a problem that we can\u2019t solve using off-the-shelf stuff,\u201d Elliot says, \u201cwe just carry on and build it. We\u2019re full of engineers.\u201d\nIt\u2019s this mindset that led to the development of IOR\u2019s proprietary HyDip\u00ae fuel management system. An IoT-enabled HyDip sensor placed in a fuel storage tank at one of IOR\u2019s fuel stops provides real-time measurement of the amount of product in the tank. IOR\u2019s operations team can remotely monitor fuel levels recorded by the sensor using a control panel on a smartphone or laptop. They can also communicate with HyDip site controllers to control fuel dispensers and flow computers remotely. The HyDip system also makes it easy for IOR\u2019s customers to pay for their fuel at any fuel stop using an RFID tag or a smartphone payment app.\n\u201cThe networks we operate with are extremely challenging. Some sites we operate are at the very boundaries of signal reception, others get signal only a few days a week, and managing a traditional network endpoint via SSH is just a non-starter under these conditions. With Meraki, you can pre-load network changes while a device is offline and what you can count on is that when the signal is back, so is the network.\u201d\nSince adopting Meraki solutions, IOR\u2019s site provisioning teams have been able to connect new fuel stops to the network in just minutes. Once each new site is operational, the IT team uses the Meraki dashboard to get real-time insight into the status of switches, gateways, and smart cameras across all the company\u2019s sites. This has proven to be an enormous advantage, streamlining day-to-day site management operations, and freeing up team members to devote time to other important initiatives.\nFor the past decade, Meraki has been the only enterprise networking equipment capable of supporting IOR\u2019s remote operations model at scale, but it doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\u201cThe product alignment between the cloud-managed networks supported by Meraki and the cloud-managed fuel networks supported by HyDip could not be stronger. Cameras, just a security feature for many, are fully integrated into both HyDip and IOR\u2019s operational procedures and are considered part of our service to customers. When account customers let us know about a fault through our app, the Meraki footage goes straight to the faults team to investigate, and with HyDip, we can usually help them out while they are still at the site.\u201d.\nDepending on need, IOR has a mix of Meraki switches, routers, and cellular gateways to support network connectivity at their sites, but by volume it is by far all about the Meraki cameras.\n\u201cIOR has been a Meraki customer since 2013, and from a growth standpoint, whoever gave us that first free wireless AP [access point] to trial must be smiling now.\u201d Elliot goes on to say, \u201cMeraki isn\u2019t just a solution to a problem for IOR. It\u2019s become part of the fabric of how we operate.\u201d\nLooking ahead, IOR is continuing to integrate Meraki solutions into HyDip and is exploring a list of innovative other new use cases to enhance security, the customer support experience, and the integrity of its fuel stops."

    "text": "\nThe population of the state of South Australia is spread across 7.7 million square kilometers\u2014much of which is remote desert and farmland. One of the most remote schools in this region is Oodnadatta Aboriginal School, located near the western edge of the Simpson Desert\u2014more than 1,000 km from Adelaide. The school is small, with only 17 enrolled students, two teachers, one principal, and two additional support staff.\nDespite the size and remote location of Oodnadatta and other schools, the Government of South Australia, Department for Education, is committed to empowering \u201call South Australian children and young people with the knowledge, skills, and capabilities they need to become fulfilled individuals, active, compassionate citizens, and lifelong learners.\u201d\nPart of this commitment is ensuring that schools have the educational resources they need, such as fast, reliable internet access. Meeting the connectivity needs of these remote communities is a considerable challenge, which falls on the Department for Education\u2019s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) team. This includes ensuring that 515 K\u201312 schools and preschools throughout the state have access to the internet.\nThis is the story of how the ICT team accomplished this feat for Oodnadatta and hundreds of other schools throughout South Australia with the help of Cisco Meraki.\nTo say that Oodnadatta\u2019s internet access was slow and unreliable would be an understatement. Oodnadatta\u2019s internet access was via ISDN, which has a maximum speed of 128 Kbps. At that speed it would take a little over two minutes to download a 1 MB file. That might be sufficient for web browsing, but streaming and remote learning would be bogged down, and this is assuming the local network equipment was up to the task. It wasn\u2019t. Copper cabling, saturated access points, and no ability to monitor data traffic were just some of Oodnadatta\u2019s connectivity issues.\nAnother problem was that Oodnadatta\u2019s network was old. Some switches had been sitting in cabinets collecting ten years\u2019 worth of dust. Network failures were frequent, which meant the ICT team would have to spend more than 11 hours driving each way, sometimes weekly, to troubleshoot network and connectivity issues. The school staff was so accustomed to the network connection being down that \u201cthey often wouldn\u2019t call us if there was a problem because they were so used to it not working,\u201d explained Samuel Shipp, Team Leader of ICT Services, Government of South Australia, Department for Education.\nWhile Oodnadatta may have represented one of the most egregious examples of connectivity problems, it wasn\u2019t alone. Numerous other schools across the state faced similar challenges. If the Department for Education was to stand by its commitment, some things would have to change. Not only would the remote schools need to gain access to fast, reliable internet connections, but the schools\u2019 network equipment would need to be modernized as well.\nGeographically speaking, our decision to partner with Meraki was motivated by the accessibility of their dashboard interface. This feature substantially reduces the need for physical travel between various school site locations.\nProgram Lead, Extended Support Program, Government of South Australia, Department for Education\nFrom this, the South Australia Department for Education\u2019s SWiFT project was born, named after the swift family of birds, which are fast-flying birds that can fly long distances. The project\u2019s primary goal was to provide high-speed, reliable internet to all of South Australia\u2019s public schools, whether they were in metro regions or the remote desert. \u201cSince 2018, we\u2019ve been on a trajectory to ensure every student, every teacher across our system has access to quality educational outcomes through the use of digital technology,\u201d said Dan Hughes, Chief Information Officer of ICT Services. \u201cAs part of that, we\u2019ve focused our efforts on helping regional schools uplift their digital foundations.\u201d\nA major part of the project was providing schools with high-speed fiber optic connections. For locations where this wasn\u2019t practical, such as Oodnadatta, they were instead outfitted with high-speed satellite-based internet access. But this alone was not enough. As Webber eloquently put it, \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good to have a superhighway internet coming into each school, but when you\u2019ve got an aged network, there\u2019s no point in having high-speed internet if your network infrastructure is underperforming.\u201d\nAn equally important part of the project was ensuring that schools had the necessary network infrastructure to take full advantage of these high-speed connections. This meant upgrading the network equipment of hundreds of widely dispersed schools. Early on in the project, the ICT team met with a number of vendors to discuss how to approach the network remediation upgrades. During these conversations, several of the vendors suggested that Meraki offered the best set of solutions that could help the team accomplish the colossal feat of getting every school up to digital speed.\nIn evaluating Meraki, the ICT team was impressed with the solutions\u2019 ease of deployment, connectivity capabilities, and end-to-end visibility. They were especially excited with how the intuitive Meraki dashboard could help make thousands of kilometers of driving a thing of the past. Webber explained, \u201cA large part of the reason we partnered with Meraki was how the solutions are reliable and accessible from anywhere with the dashboard, which can significantly cut down on travel time between site locations.\u201d\nImplementing Meraki has revolutionised our ability to support public school networks, particularly in regional and remote schools.\nSenior ICT Account Manager, ICT Services, Government of South Australia, Department for Education\nSuch a mammoth undertaking doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but five years after starting the SWiFT project, 515 schools have been outfitted with high-speed internet access, with about 300 of the schools implementing Meraki equipment. This represents 725 separate Meraki networks made up of 10,233 Meraki devices that see 124,857 unique clients per week, all of which generates 2,284 TB of data per week. In fact, this project made ICT Services the largest owner of Meraki equipment in the country.\n\u201cImplementing Meraki has revolutionized our ability to support government public school networks, particularly in regional and remote schools,\u201d said Murton. \u201cThe introduction of Meraki has brought about numerous benefits that have undeniably enhanced educational outcomes for both staff and students. These reliable, modern, and effective Meraki networks have played a pivotal role in this transformation.\u201d\nFor Oodnadatta, this meant students and staff now had access to a breadth of online resources that were simply not available to them before. It allowed students to collaborate and learn in new, innovative ways. With reliable, high-speed internet in place, the school has started seeing a consistent increase in students\u2019 daily attendance.\nOne of the most noticeable benefits for ICT was how much less they needed to travel to the schools for network support. \u201cPrior to Meraki, we\u2019d have to drive out to the school to try to fix any little issue,\u201d explained Murton. \u201cNow, I can just log into the dashboard from anywhere and make a few minor changes. It saves us two days of travel.\u201d Webber added, \u201cThe dashboard\u2019s been a lifesaver for us, logistically. We can see that every wireless access point is working in Oodnadatta, which is 1,000 kilometers away. That\u2019s gold for us.\u201d\nThe dashboard also provided a level of visibility ICT had not experienced before. \u201cWe had no idea about how much data was flowing over the school\u2019s networks,\u201d said Murton. \u201cBut with the new network, we could now see access point density. The old network would failover because the access point would be saturated. This gave us an opportunity to actually see what was happening in these networks across the state, which was just massive for us.\u201d\nShipp added, \u201cI love working in the dashboard. It\u2019s very visual, and I\u2019m a very visual kind of a person. It also makes training staff a whole lot easier.\u201d\nAs to how Meraki has helped Oodnadatta specifically, Shipp stated, \u201cSince we have improved the network\u2014and the students\u2019 experience\u2014more kids are turning up just so they can have an online experience. For this population, the school is one of the only places they can be online. And it\u2019s not just about the kids. Meraki allows the educators to deliver the curriculum in modern ways.\u201d\n\u201cThese networking advancements have allowed us to provide a metro experience for all of the schools, regardless of where they\u2019re located,\u201d explained Murton. Webber added, \u201cAnd this has helped us level the playing field for all students across South Australia.\u201d"

    "text": "Tarrytown Expocare Pharmacy is a long-term care institutional pharmacy specializing in the underserved intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) community. With ten locations and regulatory approval in 30 states across the U.S., Tarrytown Expocare works with facilities such as group homes or foster families to provide essential medications to residents in their care.\nThe privately held company has become well known for its efficient shipments of monthly prescription cycle fills, and a unique color-coded blister pack that makes it easy for residents or their caregivers, who often have no clinical certifications, to safely administer medications.\nFounded in 1941 as an Austin, Texas, retail family pharmacy, which still operates, Tarrytown Expocare was spun out in 2007 to serve that state\u2019s IDD community. In 2020, company founder Mark Newberry sought private equity financing to rapidly expand its operations to help IDD residents across the United States. The company has since grown to about $250 million in annual revenues.\nWith the private equity financing came a new executive team, hired to aggressively grow the business. Scott Walker joined as CIO in April 2020, bringing more than a decade of experience working in the institutional pharmacy sector. His role was to quickly prepare their IT to support the company\u2019s growth plan. He built out two technology teams: a pharmacy software and an IT Support/Administration group. This included finding strategic partners to outsource several functions, allowing the internal team to focus on the rapidly growing business. Today, Tarrytown Expocare employs only 14 people in full-time tech roles.\nTo meet state regulations, the company\u2019s expansion strategy often requires establishing a new physical location, typically through the acquisition of a small, existing pharmacy. \u201cThey may be a single-standing pharmacy that\u2019s used duct tape and bailing wire to put their computer systems together,\u201d says Walker. The rapid acquisitions required modernizing the IT systems to integrate with central operations and help the new pharmacy run with an efficiency that differentiates it from local competitors. Tarrytown Expocare needed a way to easily connect and remotely manage the IT infrastructure at new locations to enable business growth.\nHaving used Cisco Meraki networking solutions in his three previous roles, Walker again looked to the Meraki platform to facilitate his IT needs.\nWalker devised a streamlined deployment model that starts with preconfigured Meraki MS switches, MR access points, and MX security and SD-WAN appliances. Simplified and centralized cloud management allows a mid-level IT administrator to quickly set up and configure the full Meraki network at a new location. Almost immediately, Walker\u2019s team can begin to focus on migrating all computing and storage out of the pharmacy and into the cloud, as well as implement cloud-based virtual desktop and unified communications systems. The integration of a site-to-site VPN tunnel also allows the team to easily set up SD-WAN to access the old pharmacy system and begin switching it over to Tarrytown Expocare\u2019s platform.\nCisco Meraki simplifies network management so you don\u2019t need a highly skilled specialist for that role. It\u2019s easy to implement and easy to support for the entry-level to mid-level IT person.\nCIO, Tarrytown Expocare Pharmacy\nThis templated approach has expedited the modernization of IT systems in eight new locations, bringing them each online within 90 days of acquisition.\nNone of that could have happened without the simplicity of Meraki networking, says Walker. \u201cI can send a person without specialized training and get the entire network converted. It has saved us headaches as well as the cost of having to hire additional IT support to manage our networks,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe expediency of getting these new locations on our network has immediate business value.\u201d\nRapidly expanding a pharmacy business comes with many complexities, but in Tarrytown Expocare\u2019s small IT shop, network management is not one of them. The cloud-based Meraki platform takes care of security patches and version updates on its own, \u201cso you can stop thinking about it,\u201d says Walker. \u201cThe benefits of cloud-based services can\u2019t be understated.\u201d The rest is entrusted to the four IT generalists on his operations team. The ease of deployment and management removes the need for a senior-level IT person to set up, configure, and administer the network at each location. \u201cBecause it\u2019s got a great user interface, I can have my Windows system administrators learn Meraki and they can sufficiently manage and monitor the network.\u201d\nThe expediency of getting these new locations on our network has immediate business value. Meraki is a key component of that success.\nCIO, Tarrytown Expocare Pharmacy\nIn fact, the intuitiveness of Meraki technology helps spread responsibility for network monitoring. \u201cAlerts from the Meraki services go to our entire IT department,\u201d says Walker. It\u2019s important for the Pharmacy Services team, for instance, to know for themselves if a location can\u2019t connect to their software, not just one or two network specialists.\nAs with many IT departments, Walker\u2019s team is at the nexus of numerous critical business initiatives, from improving its mobile app and web experience to pursuing more automation. As the company pushes into the future, Walker and his team appreciate how Meraki has made concerns over network management a thing of the past. \u201cMy \u2018easy button\u2019 stopped working probably 30 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI appreciate how Meraki simplifies that part of my world.\u201d"

With four different switching vendors in place, the network had grown increasingly complex and unwieldy over time, making day-to-day management activities inefficient and time-consuming.\nThe performance limitations of the existing network were also making it extremely challenging for the IT team to meet the technology needs of faculty, students, and staff, which were evolving rapidly. Secure, seamless, and reliable wireless access from anywhere is a must in today\u2019s higher education environment. This is especially important at Pima, as its many applied programs make use of the latest wireless and IoT devices to give their students the kind of cutting-edge training that will prepare them for success in their chosen careers.\nConsolidating from multiple vendors to one for switching, wireless, and security just makes things a lot easier for our network and security teams\u2014especially going with Cisco Secure and Cisco Meraki.\nPima Community College\nAfter evaluating network solutions from three different vendors, Pima selected Cisco Meraki networking equipment as the foundation for the transformation of its legacy network because of it\u2019s ease of use and intuitive dashboard.\nPima completely re-architected the network and rolled out the Meraki solution rapidly. Over a nine-month period, the IT team deployed 400 Meraki MS switches and over 1,000 MR access points across Pima\u2019s 12 campuses, an impressive accomplishment given that the project was completed while school was in session. The deployment also included Meraki MV smart cameras and MT sensors to meet the needs of the facilities department and the college\u2019s various faculties.\nAs part of its transformation initiative, the college also implemented a coherent security architecture based on the Cisco security portfolio, which includes Cisco SecureX, Cisco Umbrella, Cisco Secure Endpoints, Talos, and Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).\nWith the new highly secure wireless network in place, the user experience is greatly improved with fast, reliable connectivity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a seamless experience for faculty, students, and staff to connect to one Wi-Fi SSID,\u201d says Jack, \u201cand based on the device and the user log-in, it gets them where they need to go.\u201d\nGiven the climate extremes of the Arizona desert, Pima needs to be especially mindful of its heating and cooling usage. Some of the new use cases Pima\u2019s network supports include the use of Meraki MT sensors to monitor the temperature in classrooms and in other facilities on campus. If students or faculty find that a particular room or area within a building is too hot or too cold, the facilities team can move a sensor into the area to track the temperature trends and use the data to fine-tune the HVAC system.\nStudents in the college\u2019s culinary programs can now take advantage of Wi-Fi-enabled commercial ovens that provide precise temperature control from a phone or tablet. And with the introduction of Meraki MV cameras, Pima has been exploring new potential use cases beyond just physical security. Remote students in EMT, nursing, and other healthcare programs will be able to watch livestream feeds with close-up views of their fellow students as they perform hands-on procedures using highly specialized and expensive medical equipment, such as wireless handheld ultrasound machines and IoT-enabled medical mannequins.\nSince modernizing its access network with the Meraki solution, Pima has realized a variety of important benefits. Going from four vendors to a single\u2013vendor  solution has enabled Pima to remove complexity and eliminate operational silos. With the Meraki dashboard, IT staff can easily manage all the Meraki equipment from one place, which improves efficiency and significantly reduces the team\u2019s operational burden.\nThe solution is highly reliable and when disruptions and outages do occur, they can be pinpointed and resolved quickly.\n\u201cBeing able to get on the dashboard and see all the devices to quickly determine if there\u2019s a switch that has an issue or an AP that has an issue has been so impactful to my team,\u201d says Jack, \u201cthere\u2019s a much quicker resolution when you have that common platform to work from.\u201d Plus, by using the Cisco ThousandEyes platform, Pima can see beyond the four walls of their campus to quickly understand how internet transit, BGP routes, and service provider outages are impacting the user experience.\nWith faster and more efficient troubleshooting, Pima will soon be able to reduce the number of dedicated resources required to manage the network from five people to three, freeing up two valuable resources to focus on other high-priority IT projects that will help Pima meet its long-term strategic goals.\nPima is taking advantage of the versatility of the Meraki solution to support a host of new high-value use cases. One such use case involves installing Meraki MT air quality sensors in automotive and aviation training facilities to prevent students from being exposed to harmful levels of solvents and different types of gases. Another use case would use Power over Ethernet (PoE) for lighting on campus, which could help Pima meet its carbon emissions reduction targets. The IT team is also continuing to work closely with faculty members from different programs to support innovative new use cases as they arise.\nOverall, with the Meraki solution in place, Pima has a reliable, secure, and scalable network that gives it the flexibility, features, and performance it needs to support a diverse user community and an ever-expanding list of new educational use cases.\nInterested in learning more? Read about Pima\u2019s security transformation.\nThe simplicity with the cloud-based platforms allows my team to show users possibilities beyond just troubleshooting with the network. We have the opportunity to be more innovative.\nPima Community College"

    "text": "The Shibaura Institute of Technology is a private science and engineering university with two campuses located in Toyosu, Koto Ward, Tokyo and Fukasaku, Saitama City, Saitama. It is a science and engineering university where faculty members who are actively engaged in cutting-edge research related to a variety of fields, such as mechanical science, life science, and design contribute to society by creating a new world together with students who will take the lead in the future.\nIn addition to being named a \u201cTop Global University, Japan\u201d by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, they have established an action plan called \u201cCentennial SIT Action,\u201d whereby they aim to become a top ten Institute of Technology in Asia by 2027, which will mark their 100th anniversary.\nWhen the institute established its network infrastructure over 20 years ago, they selected Cisco Catalyst switches due to their low failure rate and high reliability. With the sudden demand for hybrid classrooms as a result of COVID-19, the institute needed to implement a cloud-managed solution compatible with Wi-Fi 6\u2014 and they looked no further than cloud-monitoring solutions from Cisco Meraki.\nDeputy Director of the Division of Information Network Systems, Takahiro Wagatsuma, explained the reason why they decided to use Cloud Monitoring for Catalyst. \u201cI first learned about Cloud Monitoring for Catalyst at an academic forum in June of 2022, just after it was released. Status visualization is an attractive feature for our institute since we operate the network ourselves. Since this cloud service does not require any additional costs, we decided to use it.\u201d\nMr. Wagatsuma explained some of the challenges the institute had been facing. \u201cUntil now, real-time monitoring was used for switches, so when a failure occurred, all we could do was respond for each unit. The institute has campuses in Tokyo and Saitama, and each has staff for responding to such things, but our ability to respond was limited. Problems that occur during classes always require urgent responses since these are online. Because of our bring your own device (BYOD) policy, there are many terminals of various types used throughout the institute, so we face a number of unique issues when it comes to bandwidth, connection, and security.\u201d\nCloud Monitoring for Catalyst is a feature that allows for comprehensive monitoring of Catalyst switches, along with Meraki devices, via the Meraki dashboard. To use this feature, a DNA license (Essentials or Advantage) is needed. However, since Cisco Catalyst 9000 Series switches include a DNA license when purchased, they can be used at no extra cost as long as the license is still valid.\n\u201cThe institute was already using the Meraki dashboard to manage the Meraki MR wireless access points. Now, Cloud Monitoring for Catalyst allows us to monitor the whole network, including Catalyst switches. Because it\u2019s a cloud-based service, we can monitor both campuses from anywhere. The conditions of traffic, apps, and terminals are visualized, so we can quickly identify where a problem has occurred, the cause, and range of impact, which means we can respond faster,\u201d says Mr Wagatsuma.\nCloud Monitoring for Catalyst shows front panel information on the device details screen. It is also possible to reference the status, traffic volume, and settings for each port. Mr. Wagatsuma describes how \u201calerts can be understood at a glance, so we can notice even minor abnormalities, which couldn\u2019t be seen before. We can check the details without having to use the command-line interface (CLI) for each port, which is really convenient. Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) errors and other errors related to communication between switches, such as inconsistent VLAN settings, can be recognized and handled before a failure occurs.\u201d\nThe institute has gradually increased target devices for monitoring. Currently, around 160 Meraki MR access points and Catalyst switches are being monitored via Cloud Monitoring for Catalyst.\nBecause the Meraki dashboard is graphical and intuitive, it is very user friendly and has helped Mr. Wagatsuma\u2019s team streamline operations. The dashboard also provides a new level of visibility to his team. \u201cYou can see the health score of each device, communication between devices, and even the status at each terminal, which means causes can easily be identified. Troubleshooting has also become much faster. Faculty members often say, \u2018there was a problem with the Wi-Fi during this lecture yesterday.\u2019 In the past, the only way to address such problems was to be present at the next lecture to monitor the status. But with Meraki, we can specify a past time zone that was recorded and see the status at that time.\u201d Cloud Monitoring for Catalyst also allows the team to comprehensively grasp which terminal had an issue at that time, whether the cause was a switch or access point, and even determine whether the cause was interference with another channel or a setting configured on the terminal. At the institute, authentication is required in order to use Wi-Fi, so it is possible to monitor the status of each person\u2019s terminal in real time.\nBecause we can easily identify the cause of a problem, we can give clear direction on how to handle it, which was difficult in the past.\nDeputy Director, Division of Information Network Systems, Shibaura Institute of Technology\nMr. Wagatsuma concluded his expectations by stating the following about the Meraki cloud-based management solutions: \u201cThe support response with the Meraki dashboard is great. Whenever there is something I don\u2019t understand and I raise a case, engineers from all over the world respond in about 15 minutes, which is extremely helpful. Another unique feature of cloud-based solutions is that they can continue to evolve after being deployed. For example, a roaming tracking function was just recently added. I expect further evolution with Meraki that will help us to reduce the workload that is being done manually, which will result in networks that can easily be used and operated by anyone.\u201d"

    "text": "Catholic Education, Diocese of Wagga Wagga serves 24 primary schools and five secondary schools.\nThe Diocese prides itself on being \u201cstronger together\u201d and prioritizes the experiences of its students, teachers, and staff. The learning and teaching teams work to maximize the growth and well-being of their students by providing an inspiring learning environment. Their priority is to promote and build communities of learners who experience engaging, purposeful education.\nTechnology plays a significant role in all aspects of education for the Diocese, from school operations to teacher instruction to the channels of student learning. IT not only helps enhance the teaching and learning at each school location, which are very dispersed, but also promotes collaboration and seamless communication between students and faculty.\nRecognizing the critical role of technology, the Diocese was facing several challenges when trying to modernize their schools. The team was tasked with managing the dispersed locations and limited IT resources while prioritizing student experiences and safety and promoting seamless communication.\nWith our previous network solution, visibility was poor and we were often having issues with troubleshooting. With Meraki, we have central control of the network  without the need of on-prem controllers and dedicated teams.\nSenior Technical Services Officer, Catholic Education, Diocese of Wagga Wagga\nPhilip Baaten and Brad Merchant serve as Senior Technical Services Officers at the organization\u2019s headquarters in Wagga Wagga, overseeing a team of eight technical staff who support the Diocese at large. At each secondary school, a small technical team manages the site under their guidance.\nThe management of such a large number of schools with a limited support staff presents a unique set of challenges. Budget constraints are a common issue faced by many educational institutions, and the Diocese is no exception. Limited resources make it challenging to attract and retain experienced and skilled staff, specifically IT staff, to develop and manage best- practice solutions.\nThe Diocese also faces the ongoing challenge of ensuring the security of information, students, and staff due to its wide range of technologies, the broad geographical distance of its schools, and a small technology team. These issues are a constant focus for Philip and Brad, who work diligently to ensure that the organization\u2019s technical infrastructure remains secure and up-to-date to support a seamless and safe learning environment.\nThe decision to partner with Meraki proved instrumental in addressing the network management challenges faced by Catholic Education, Diocese of Wagga Wagga. Leveraging the Meraki comprehensive suite of solutions, including the intuitive dashboard, indoor and outdoor MV smart cameras, and cloud-managed switches, the Diocese achieved a transformative network infrastructure.\nI would describe our relationship with Meraki as a great partnership. When we first deployed the Meraki solution, we were blown away by the ability to clone networks and deploy ridiculously quickly,- and we continue to be impressed by the scalability of it all.\nSenior Technical Officer, Catholic Education, Diocese of Wagga Wagga\nThe Meraki MV smart cameras have been the perfect solution for the distributed geographical nature of the schools. They work well at low- bandwidth sites and don\u2019t require additional DVRs or equipment to be installed. MV cameras allow each school to manage their smart surveillance fleet independently of other schools across the Diocese, ensuring the Diocese meets their internal security requirements.\nThe implementation of Meraki solutions has delivered remarkable improvements in network management capabilities for Catholic Education, Diocese of Wagga Wagga. A key benefit has been the streamlining of operations.- IT can spend less time troubleshooting the network, which has eliminated the need for a dedicated network team, and resulted in substantial cost savings for the organization.\nThe intuitive and user-friendly interface of the Meraki dashboard has empowered even IT technicians with limited experience to administer and manage the network with ease. By providing a unified platform, Meraki has streamlined end-to-end troubleshooting and administration, simplifying the management of the organization\u2019s network infrastructure and reducing site visits by over 90%.\nConfiguration and deployment of switching and network infrastructure has become remarkably straightforward. Previously, updating all 220 switches would take weeks, but with Meraki, this task is now accomplished within days, with minimal impact to users. This not only saves time but also ensures the network remains up-to-date with the latest security features and protocols,- and helps minimize interruptions to daily operations and teacher instruction.\nThanks to the centralized management capabilities of Meraki, the small network team led by Philip can effortlessly oversee the 29 school sites.

    "text": "With over 1,000 employees in 60 facilities, Caritas Association for the City of Bonn e.V. provides support through a range of services and social offerings for people who are facing difficult situations and marginalization.\nFor over a century, the association has worked closely with the community, providing support for individuals with specific aid and offerings. As the charity welfare association of the Catholic Church, it defines its tasks based on the fundamental tenets of Christian belief.\nWith Meraki, we now have a centrally controlled solution. I have more visibility into the network through the dashboard\u2014it\u2019s been a huge benefit.\nIT Director, Caritas Association for the City of Bonn e.V.\nDigital services play an essential role in the charitable and nonprofit work of Caritas Association for the City of Bonn e.V.\u2014especially as more and more people need access from their homes and cannot participate in person. An expanded digital infrastructure also facilitates work processes and helps streamline operations, allowing for employees to spend more time with the people they are serving.\nOver the past few years, the association has continued to increase its focus on digitalization and set plans for expanding to a standardized and centralized network infrastructure that would be both reliable and secure.\nThe existing solutions were working in silos and needed to be replaced by a centrally controlled enterprise solution. Christian Feddern, IT Director for Caritas Bonn, along with six employees, was tasked with working on the digital future for the association\u2014and they looked no further than Cisco Meraki to help them establish a centralized, intuitive solution.\nMeraki was already a partner within the IT corporation among the Caritas Associations of Cologne, Rhein-Erft, D\u00fcsseldorf, and Rheinkreis Neuss, which also includes Caritas Bonn. Mr. Feddern became aware of the Meraki centrally controlled solution via close collaboration with colleagues.\nSince Meraki had already been a reliable partner that Mr. Feddern had experience with, he had confidence behind the brand. He decided to trial the Meraki solution in his own office with an eight-port switch and one access point. Mr. Feddern was impressed by the ease of deployment and was quickly convinced that the Meraki solution would be a beneficial partner for Caritas Bonn.\nMr. Feddern initially deployed 150 Meraki MR access points and 33 MS switches in a total of 15 locations. The setup, configuration, and activation of the solution worked immediately. Mr. Feddern was instantly impressed by the increased visibility into the network that the single dashboard provided.\nImpressive user-friendly interface\nThe feedback and monitoring possibilities are particular aids to Mr. Feddern and his team in their work. The dashboard makes it possible to remotely and systemically process requests with little effort through the aid of diagnostic tools. Beyond this, the team can manage the existing Meraki network and amend the configuration as needed.\nMr. Feddern especially values the fact that Cisco quality is combined with the comprehensibility of an intuitive interface. He had been working with graphical user interfaces for over 35 years and was incredibly impressed by the user-friendly nature of the Meraki interface.\nThe first big project was carried out in one of three nursing homes when implementing the new digital care documentation. Since then, the deployment of switches and access points has made it possible for the nursing staff to securely document care information in the software on a mobile device. This allows the staff more time for people and ensures reliable quality of care. Beyond this, the residents have stable and secure Wi-Fi available in their rooms and can now communicate with family and friends via video chat.\nWith Meraki, Mr. Feddern is able to meet the requirements of the facility management via separate SSID networks for care documentation for residents and their relatives, staff, and visitors within one infrastructure. He can make up to 12 more SSID networks available while configuring and controlling each individual network separately, and new updates are automatically installed at night at a time set by him, which saves his team time traveling between locations.\nGuests also now get Wi-Fi access by voucher, which can be done by a guest administrator thanks to the intuitive operation of the dashboard. This also makes it possible for Mr. Feddern and his team to adjust the bandwidth depending on the user group. Additionally, they have more visibility into connected devices and can manage their network access.\nThe access points can also be activated easily on-site, which saves the IT team valuable time. The team can also implement complex configurations if needed, and as Feddern explains, this provides the perfect combination of \u201ccomplexity\u201d and \u201csimplicity\u201d that is an important aspect of a solution for Caritas Bonn\u2019s needs.\nAnother advantage for Feddern is that the Meraki solution is legal under the Church Data Protection Act (KDG). He considers this a milestone, since it makes the use of the solution far easier.\nLooking to the future, Mr. Feddern and his team have big plans to expand their partnership with Meraki through IoT devices such as sensors for monitoring humidity and temperatures.\nWe had Cisco quality combined with the comprehensibility of Meraki\u2019s great, intuitive user interface.\nIT Director, Caritas Association for the City of Bonn e.V."

    "text": "MobileOne is one of the largest independent retail dealers of T-Mobile U.S. Operating under the T-Mobile banner, MobileOne has 200 locations in 14 states in the south central, southwestern, and western regions of the U.S., adhering to specific requirements for store layouts, displays, and security.\nFounded in 2008 with a single store and four employees, MobileOne has grown and now employs 1,500 people. After T-Mobile\u2019s 2020 mega-merger with Sprint Corporation, MobileOne acquired seven other retail dealers, quickly expanding to more than 300 locations at one point before consolidating.\nWhen MobileOne hired Kade Clifton in June 2020, he became the first and only full-time IT employee. His primary responsibility was looking after the networks at 126 geographically dispersed locations, including the aging network video recorder (NVR) systems that each store leased to watch over their inventory of high-value mobile devices and electronics. He quickly saw that the status quo was not tenable. For instance, to enable remote viewing of video footage, he would manually configure network ports through the firewall and individually code IP addresses into the phones of regional managers.\nTo support everything in our company without many people, I needed automated updates and configurations that could be set once and applied across our networks. Meraki did that for us.\nIT Manager, MobileOne\nClifton needed to simplify management of MobileOne\u2019s stores quickly to lay the groundwork for the company\u2019s aggressive growth plans following the Sprint merger. Clifton sought a templated deployment model that could swiftly replace the hodgepodge of networks and cameras at newly acquired stores with highly scalable, automated technology. A standardized package of network hardware, cameras, and environmental sensors was essential\u2014and as a one-person IT shop, intuitive, centralized management of everything would be critical.\nClifton was already familiar with Cisco Meraki network equipment from previously deploying it on school campuses. His on-site trials of competitive systems at MobileOne stores confirmed Meraki as the best fit.\u202fIn late 2020, MobileOne turned to Cisco Meraki partner Stratus Information Systems to help scope its specific requirements and placements for Meraki MV smart-cameras and procure all Meraki hardware.\nMobileOne also delegated Stratus to complete on-site installation across 230 stores. Thanks to the plug-and-play nature of Meraki solutions, Stratus completed the task in less than three months . Clifton and the Stratus team established a streamlined workflow, collaborating daily on a spreadsheet in the cloud, and Clifton provided blueprints of where to place the switches, access points, cameras, and sensors in each store. From his location in San Diego, he used the cloud-based Meraki dashboard to quickly identify the networks as they came online and connected them to specific Internet of things (IoT) security devices.\nStandard deployment included four Meraki MV smart-cameras: two directional cameras for a high-value display and the back room inventory vault and two fisheye cameras for a general overview of the sales floor. And with on-device storage and Cloud Archive, MobileOne eliminated the risk of losing video evidence due to a thief disabling an on-site NVR.\nMobileOne also installed a Meraki MT indoor open/close sensor on each store\u2019s inventory safe and linked the back room camera to it, offering further protection with real-time alerts. Should the door be left open, the regional manager and the loss prevention team receive automatic notifications, eliminating requirements for constant monitoring and streamlining investigations.\nToday, Clifton manages all 200 networks\u2014one for each remaining store\u2014and 1,100 IoT devices from the Meraki dashboard. For anyone who needs to remotely monitor video, Clifton provides them with personalized views on the Meraki Vision Portal web app, and he can add any camera within the organization to a single customized display of multiple live feeds.\nWith cloud-based networking I can now troubleshoot from anywhere. I have fixed many issues remotely, even from a golf course on a cellular-enabled tablet.\nIT Manager, MobileOne\nClifton creates Meraki Vision Portals for various use cases. Regional managers, for instance, use a laptop or mobile device to view real-time video of their stores to ensure they open on time each morning. Similarly, area directors get access to feeds from all stores across their regions. At MobileOne corporate headquarters, large displays cycle through store video feeds, allowing executives to instantly understand store traffic levels and monitor the customer experience.\nSmart processing features like object detection and motion searching add additional value for MobileOne. For example, if a speaker gets stolen off a wall display, the loss prevention team simply places motion sensing on that portion of the video feed to quickly identify when it went missing. In addition to more advanced analytics, such as traffic counting and heat mapping that can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, the fisheye MV cameras also include a de-warping feature so managers can focus on certain areas of the sales floor.\nSupported by favorable financing rates from Cisco Capital, the upfront investment in Meraki networking and IoT devices is already paying for itself. By replacing expensive monthly leases on NVR devices, MobileOne estimates it will save nearly $500,000 over five years. After that, Clifton expects only occasional hardware replacement costs and an annual licensing fee, further contributing to overall savings.\nBut for MobileOne, the real advantages of its Meraki solution are scale and simplicity. As the retail chain eyes further expansion, Meraki provides the automation and operational efficiency that will enable Clifton to manage it all."

    "text": "\nWhen you think of a library, do you imagine a grand Beaux-Arts-style building with cool marble floors and quiet stacks of books lining hundreds of shelves? If so, you might be envisioning Columbus Metropolitan Library (CML), with a rich history dating back to its inception as a humble reading room in 1873, and evolving into a massive monument in 1907, thanks to a significant contribution from industrialist Andrew Carnegie.\nFlash forward to the 21st century and you\u2019ll find that today\u2019s CML is more than just a single structure. It\u2019s a vibrant community gathering place that encompasses 22 neighborhood branches and a modernized Main Library, plus extensive green spaces.\nInformation security for us is very critical. It\u2019s important that we are doing everything we can to keep our operations running and secure to help our customers maintain safe internet connections. Our top priority is to keep staff and customer information secure.\nTechnology at Columbus Metropolitan Library\nCML is a beloved fixture in the greater Columbus metropolitan area, but serving upwards of 3.8 million visitors each year comes with challenges. Today\u2019s visitors expect quality Wi-Fi access from any location in the 23 physical library sites and the surrounding grounds. Think high ceilings, multiple floors, and park-like outdoor spaces\u2014all needing reliable, secure internet access.\nIn addition to providing internet access for visitors on their own devices and on library computers, the CML IT team maintains a secure internal network for staff working with back-office applications that keep CML running. Of course, internet access provided to visitors must adhere to the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act and other regulations, while also being separate and secure from the system used by the nearly 900 library staff.\nHistorically, CML used a traditional wireless system and LAN controller housed in the organization\u2019s 20-year-old data center. The organization wanted to modernize with a reliable, easy-to-use networking and wireless solution to help them continue serving community members for decades.\n\u201cFor the last several years we had been working to free ourselves from day-to-day operations of server management,\u201d explains Justin Bumbico, Director of Information Technology at Columbus Metropolitan Library. \u201cWe had the plan and direction to shut down an underutilized data center that was built over 20 years ago.\u201d\nBut how can a public library afford enterprise-grade security, networking, and Wi-Fi access equipment?\nCML found answers\u2014and $3 million in Category 2-level funding assistance\u2014with Cisco Meraki and the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s E-Rate program over the course of seven years. The E-Rate program offers discounts for schools and libraries for broadband implementation and support, including Wi-Fi access. Bumbico credits the E-Rate program discounts for making it possible to implement such a valuable solution, considering that \u201cthe cabling alone for the Main Library would normally cost nearly $500,000.\u201d\nWith assistance from technology partner CDW-G, the CML IT team deployed a solution built on Meraki MX multifunctional security and SD-WAN enterprise appliances. They worked together to integrate 28 MX appliances, 40 UPS systems, 114 MS switches, 224 MR wireless access points, and data cabling\u2014all easily managed via a single Meraki dashboard.\nThe MX is a highly secure appliance with multiple advanced security technologies built in, such as next-gen firewall and IDS/IPS, that can be managed by any IT team member at CML  with the intuitive GUI of the Meraki platform. CML had already been using Cisco Umbrella for content filtering and malware protection, and the MX natively integrates with it.\nIn a matter of a few simple clicks, the IT team at CML can configure layer-7 traffic shaping rules and enable IDS/IPS protection to control bandwidth and secure internet traffic. This allows CML network admins to easily see precisely how their network is being used and can reserve bandwidth for critical applications while restricting nonessential network usage.\nSD-WAN gives CML the flexibility to send some traffic out of lower cost connections and provides them with resiliency if the primary path is degraded or unavailable. Additionally, rate limiting peer-to-peer traffic with the MX appliances allows the IT team to ensure sufficient bandwidth is available for visitors and staff.\nCML currently manages a full stack of MX, MS, and MR products across each of their locations\u2014managing a unified platform helps ensure efficiency and streamlined operations.\nCisco Meraki MX allows us to control our devices at a granular level, meaning that the public can have continuous access to internet resources, while we help keep malware threats out of our network.\nMetropolitan Library\nThe Meraki solution makes it easy for CML to stay true to its philosophy of \u201copen to all\u201d by offering online services, providing free Wi-Fi throughout all library locations, and creating a hub for learning that includes free internet-connected computer use.\nThe Meraki cloud-managed solution fits in well with CML\u2019s plans to move away from data center management and eventually retire the old data center. Now there is no need to run additional management servers or wireless LAN controllers for the solution. And the CML IT team doesn\u2019t have to worry about working with extra management software to perform firmware updates because the Meraki platform provides continuous automatic smartphone-like firmware updates.\nBumbico is pleased with the results, noting: \u201cThe Cisco Meraki platform includes cloud components and all the management and enterprise security features built into it. We don\u2019t have to run additional management servers to control the solution.\u201d\nBetter yet, nearly every element of the Meraki solution was eligible for E-Rate funding. With such a positive initial experience, CML is planning additional projects, knowing they can get quality products like those from Meraki."

    "text": "The leader of the pharmaceutical retail market in Romania, Catena has established itself not only as an authentic brand with over 22 years in operation, but also as the most trusted pharmacy network in the country.\nThe Catena brand has a mission of encouraging healthy, harmonious lifestyle choices while also meeting essential criteria for their customers such as proximity and accessibility, good prices, and a wide range of products.\nWith more than 25,000 IT appliances connected to the network, we needed to be able to quickly see when something goes wrong\u2014and fix it. By partnering with Meraki, we\u2019ve gained visibility into traffic, the resources allocated, and the usage patterns\u2014all key to offering an exceptional service.\nIT Infrastructure Manager, Smart Soft Power\nCatena has over 900 physical locations nationwide, more than 6,500 employees and over 25,000 IT appliances connected to the network. Operating both as an essential retail and pharmaceutical business, the biggest challenge is to keep all the services up and running 24/7 all year.\nCatena was experiencing a time of accelerated growth, and their network solution was not able to handle added locations. Smart Soft Power, the IT company responsible for managing Catena\u2019s infrastructure, was encountering a variety of challenges to scale the solution.\n\u201dWhen we had to make some configuration changes, we needed to update each router individually as we did not have cloud or centralized management. We had essentially no visibility across traffic, sources, or destinations, and also no security features were available on that solution. We have to be online 24/7 all year, so availability is critical. We needed security, visibility, and availability,\u201d said C\u0103t\u0103lin Burla, IT Infrastructure Manager, Smart Soft Power.\nIn 2018, Catena began intensive market research for a better solution and analyzed Cisco Meraki as well as other vendors. After an extensive analysis and real-life equipment testing, Catena embarked on a partnership with Meraki, choosing the license with the best security features available and the solution that could be implemented in the shortest period of time.\nCatena selected Meraki following a proof-of-concept process that lasted three months. During this period, Meraki met the needs the client was looking for: security, traffic visibility, and ability to scale out to more locations. The IT team anticipated that Catena would continue to grow, and they were right. The project started in 2018 with 615 locations, and by the end of that year there were already over 900.\nDue to good planning, the IT team was able to migrate all the locations to the new solution in only three months. The process was easy because they used templates and could migrate locations from one solution to another in 10-15 minutes\u2014without downtime or having to close any of Catena\u2019s many retail locations.\n\u201cWe delivered the router to the retail location where the field technician connected it to the internet. A colleague simply assigned the router to the correct template. It was that simple! In just ten minutes we were able to move a location from the old solution to Meraki. With the prior solution, this process would have taken up to three months and thousands of kilometers driven to change equipment, given the difficult-to-reach location,\u201d added Burla.\nCatena is using Meraki MX security and SD-WAN appliances, where they get the benefits of unified firewall, switching, and wireless LAN in over 900 locations\u2014all easily managed through an intuitive cloud-first dashboard.\nOne particular benefit of the Meraki partnership is the managing and securing of close to 7,000 Android devices, believed to be the third largest Meraki Android deployment globally. Catena is able to remotely optimize these Android devices for retail pharmaceutical work and utilizes Meraki Systems Manager (SM) mobile device management (MDM) to secure their extended network and derive more robust endpoint visibility.\nBurla explains that \u201cthe most significant benefit of using Meraki routers and SD-WAN is our independence from internet service providers. We can connect to our network without restrictions regardless of technology, location, or line type. With 900 locations in different towns and cities and differently sized buildings, we can now communicate over any type of infrastructure where this was previously a technical challenge. Finally, secure data connections in the workplace are a priority for us, whether data is routed between the retail location and our headquarters or to the data centre. Meraki\u2019s advanced security features make it possible for us to protect our data and equipment, no matter where our users are.\u201d\nSince partnering with Meraki, the technical support team at Smart Soft Power can quickly and easily see when something is wrong and address the issue remotely though the dashboard instead of physically traveling between locations. Before partnering with Meraki, the field technicians responsible for the maintenance services visited each location monthly\u2014costing the team both time and money. Now, thanks to the Meraki dashboard, the team visits the same location no more than once every three months.\nWith the previous solution, the Smart Soft Power team did not have any measurable uptime for the equipment or other centralized assessment. The Meraki dashboard helps the IT team see everything, allowing Catena to focus on providing better services to its customers. Quality services mean higher availability, lower cost of operation, and increased visibility for the technical team to solve the issues. Ultimately, Catena now has a more intuitive, comprehensive solution with a moderate impact on costs and operation.\nIn 2018, AnyConnect integration was not available, but after three years, this feature was incorporated in the Meraki suite. We did not expect to be able to move our VPN clients to the Meraki solution at the beginning, but this came as a bonus.\nIT Infrastructure Manager, Smart Soft Power"

    "text": "\nThe Meraki dashboard is an excellent combination of simplicity and intuitive features. Help desk staff are just one or two clicks away from client and switch information that is actionable so that problems are solved in much shorter timeframes.\nNetwork Architect at Solar A/S\nSolar A/S is a European sourcing and services company for electrical, heating, plumbing, ventilation, and climate and energy solutions. The 3,000+ employees in Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Poland focus on product sourcing, value-adding services, and optimizing customers\u2019 businesses.\nSolar A/S is on a multi-year project to update their network infrastructure\u2014switches, wireless access points, and network management\u2014to accommodate new lines of business and the applications needed to connect employees with customers worldwide.\nA primary goal of the project was to reduce and consolidate the number and types of networking devices needed to support the business and help simplify network management. The distributed help desk teams that troubleshoot network issues from employees and customers needed an easy-to-understand view of switch port status and connected devices instead of relying on the technical NetOps team at headquarters for resolutions.\nFrank Osberg, Network Architect at Solar A/S, began the project by replacing 15-year-old, end-of-life switches with 500 new Cisco Catalyst 9000 switches to significantly improve network performance among sites. Provisioning and manageability were also enhanced by transitioning to Cisco DNA Center from Cisco Prime Infrastructure. Given the higher capacity per port, this first phase reduced the number of switches needed, thus decreasing the power requirements due to the higher efficiency of the modern switches.\nOsberg\u2019s team also implemented Cisco Meraki SD-WAN to connect and manage the many sites of Solar\u2019s distributed organization. The ease of implementation of the software-defined WAN and the simplicity of Meraki cloud management convinced Osberg that moving the Cisco Catalyst switches to Meraki cloud monitoring would benefit the distributed help desk teams. The easy-to-use Meraki dashboard enables help desk teams to quickly pinpoint port and client issues that otherwise might have forced them to seek help from NetOps experts\u2014a step that increased time to resolution. A quick ten-minute proof-of-concept demo of the Meraki dashboard for the help desk managers clinched the idea that having deeper visibility into network devices would reduce the time to resolution for many common issues.\nWhile Cisco DNA Center is the primary network management system for the core NetOps team, the three regional help desks now use the Meraki dashboard to pinpoint and fix issues reported by employees and customers. As a result, the help desk teams are more self-sufficient and proactive when finding and fixing various network issues.\n\u201cInstead of going through multiple screens and using five or six applications, the help desk can find the information they need in one or two clicks. We now close tickets that used to take hours in 10 to 15 minutes. This is a time savings of more than 10%,\u201d Osberg relates.\nWith Cisco DNA Center\u2019s centralized network management, the core NetOps team has more control over details of network operations, from provisioning to monitoring to setting security policies. Meanwhile, the distributed help desk teams can gain insights into connectivity problems faster, enabling the NetOps team at headquarters to spend more time planning and implementing innovative solutions that boost the business.\nGiving our group service desk access to the Meraki dashboard simplifies and accelerates troubleshooting, while Cisco DNA Center has made my network team more agile,\u201d states Osberg. \u201cTogether, we can operate as a more unified team, solving internal technical issues and those affecting customers that the help desk can solve more efficiently.\nMore benefits can accrue from upgrading the Cisco Catalyst platform, as the process can reduce the number of network devices in use and lower energy consumption. Cisco DNA Center can also help IT better match network switching and access point capacity with projected growth in the business and optimize future upgrades, which avoids over-provisioning and energy consumption. This is important for Solar A/S\u2019s business goals, as they aim to have the Denmark headquarters run on renewable energy and be 100% self-sufficient by the end of 2024. Energy-saving achievements can help organizations make progress toward their sustainability goals."

With a distinctive teaching style and a global vision, UOS is a pioneer in academia, scientific research, and the arts, both in the UAE and across the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) region. Offering courses in seven academic fields, including medicine and engineering, the university is home to over 20,000 students and more than 700 faculty. UOS has recently been ranked the number one university in the UAE for teaching, learning, and research.\nUOS is a residential university with its main urban campus spanning over 36 sq km. An architectural marvel of Arabic heritage, the campus facilities include study halls, laboratories, libraries, state-of-the-art functional labs, theaters, two major sports complexes, dorms, restaurants, and shops.\nThe Information Technology Center (ITC) at the University of Sharjah focuses on three strategic pillars: process, technology, and people. We need to make sure that our students and staff can stay connected and all resources are available to them all the time to deliver the best services that support collaboration on campus.\nIT Director, University of Sharjah\nAs the university\u2019s wireless network began to age, it had become an obstacle to the institution\u2019s digitalization initiatives. The large campus had Wi-Fi-challenged areas, including concrete buildings and pillars, and UOS saw an urgent need to prioritize the development of a brand-new wireless network. It was envisaged that the new network would solve the Wi-Fi problems that users had been experiencing on campus, and more importantly, play a key role in the university\u2019s plans to provide digital services and seamless connectivity.\nUOS had expanded in a relatively short period of time to include 14 colleges in multiple locations, thus the need for a scalable, zero-touch solution was critical. The outcome was the renovation of the wireless network and access switches to bring a modern approach to connectivity that is secure, effective, and cloud-delivered.\nWe partnered with Meraki to support us in our digital transformation journey. We are proud to have implemented more than 5,000 access points\u2014one of the largest cloud wireless networks in the region\u2014distributed across four campus facilities.\nUniversity of Sharjah\nEngineer Mohammed Rasol Al Saidat, IT Director of the University of Sharjah, understood the challenge and knew the best option was to get in touch with Cisco to find out how Meraki switches could assist in creating a network that expanded across the 14 colleges. The solution provided a range of benefits, enhancing network performance, security, and accessibility, and also aligning with the three strategic pillars of the IT department: process, technology and people.\nThe latest Meraki edge and aggregation switching platform has accelerated the process of integrating technology into the academics. The solution includes advanced security protocols which protect the network from unauthorized access and data breaches. This is especially important as it ensures that student, administration, and faculty data is always kept safe and secure.\nAcross the network of 14 colleges, a mix of Meraki Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 were implemented, leading to more than 5,000 access points across the campus with Cisco Catalyst switches to support. This created one of the largest cloud wireless networks in the region. The user-friendly and intuitive design has made it easier for students to connect to the network and access resources they need.\nOverall, it has created a more accessible network for everyone at the University of Sharjah by providing a user-friendly interface, robust security features, and a high level of accessibility. This solution has enhanced network speeds to ensure everyone is always connected, no matter where they are on campus.\nAs we now have multiple access points across the university, I am able to attend my online lectures either in the classroom or the dorms, or even the university coffee shop. Also, I\u2019m able to do my exams at any site in the university.\nUOS student\nThe new wireless network delivers better connectivity, making it easier for students and faculty to work from within the campus area. As education transforms and technology plays an increasingly vital role in delivery, the network provides the infrastructure to support these changes and to implement them effectively and efficiently.\nThe system ensures students, faculty, and other users have the seamless connectivity and digital services that they expect in a high-tech, knowledge-driven space like the university. With this network, UOS has established itself as a visionary institution, leading the field in the modernization of higher education to create the campus of the future. The network forms the critical foundation for digitalization initiatives across education and will help future-proof the institution\u2019s IT capacity in the years ahead."

    "text": "When it comes to security systems, quality and reliability are key. These are important factors in observing our environments and taking care of the cultural heritage work that we do. Based on these requirements, we chose the Meraki solution.\nHead of Facilities, Serlachius Museums\nSerlachius Museums, the brainchild of Finnish industrialist Go\u0308sta Serlachius, are a popular destination in Finland for lovers of art, architecture, history, fine cuisine, and sauna, located some 163 miles north of Helsinki in the small town of M\u00e4ntt\u00e4-Vilppula. There are two Serlachius museums: Serlachius Museum Go\u0308sta, located in beautiful lakeside nature, and Serlachius Museum Gustaf, in the town itself.\nSerlachius Museum Go\u0308sta showcases a wide variety of art, including works by European masters such as Claude Monet\u2019s Haystack in the Evening Sun. Art exhibitions are spread throughout Go\u0308sta Serlachius\u2019 former manor home and its award-winning timber-framed extension, designed by Barcelona-based architects Hector Mendoza, Mara Partida, and Boris Bezan. The museum\u2019s famous restaurant features cuisine by Henry Tikkanen, recipient of the Finnish Chef of the Year award. Visitors can also enjoy the museum\u2019s Art Sauna, which combines architecture, art, and design, and was named Travel Industry Innovation of the Year 2022 in Finland. Art Sauna was also given the award for Concrete Structure of the Year 2022 in Finland. Serlachius Museum Gustaf also hosts changing art exhibitions and features the history of the Finnish paper industry.\nThe museums needed an upgrade to their wireless network and camera systems to improve coverage, reliability, and usability in keeping with the modern museum-going experience. The museums\u2019 former Wi-Fi network relied on Cisco classic access points (APs) that were controller based, including a high-availability pair on the controllers. While the solution worked well enough, network speeds were relatively slow by today\u2019s standards, and there were dead zones with very slow speeds to no connectivity at all.\nThe museums\u2019 camera system consisted of network video recorder (NVR)-based IP cameras from March Networks and Hikvision. From time to time, cameras would spontaneously disconnect from the network, requiring a technician to reboot and sometimes change them. The cameras had a relatively short lifespan, with about five cameras breaking each year and having to be replaced, and no warranty. There were also usability issues stemming from the fact that the cameras could only be inspected and managed via a Windows PC and not a Mac.\nRefreshing network and camera systems in an institution featuring priceless works of art and historic buildings like the Gustaf Museum building\u2014a pearl of 1930s Finnish architecture\u2014comes with unique requirements. High on the list, for security reasons, is the quality and reliability of video recordings. Jaakko Karppinen, Head of Facilities at Serlachius Museums, made the decision to go with Meraki solutions at the recommendation of Jari Gr\u00f6nroos, the museums\u2019 Core Service Account Manager. Gr\u00f6nroos was familiar with Meraki solutions and knew them to be extremely reliable and deployed in similar use cases around the world.\n\u201cWhen it comes to security systems, quality and reliability are key,\u201d Karppinen says. \u201cThese are important factors in observing our environments and taking care of the cultural heritage work that we do. Based on these requirements, we chose the Meraki solution.\u201d\nThe new solution consists of Meraki MR wireless access points and Meraki MV cameras. The team deployed more APs than in the previous solution, and easily switched out the old cameras for the Meraki cameras using existing cabling.\nThe new Meraki solution was easy to set up and deploy. After the core service team configured the MV cameras, it was a straightforward task for the electricians and core service technicians to handle deployment. For the first few days, both the old and new systems ran concurrently at the cash register with two monitors for the cameras before the team retired the old system.\nOnce the new solution was in place, the desired network speeds were achieved in all areas and the dead zones vanished. With the old solution, the museum computers were connected to the network via cables, but now they\u2019re all connected via Wi-Fi with blazing wireless speeds that make LAN connectivity unnecessary. In terms of the MV cameras, not only is the video quality excellent, but the system records the video locally and in the cloud. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant thing that we have the data stored in two places,\u201d Karppinen says.\nThere are also sustainability benefits to the new solution. With the highly reliable MV cameras, technicians no longer have to drive to the museum locations to troubleshoot disconnected cameras or replace broken ones. And when issues do occur, the Meraki cloud-based management means they can be solved remotely. Karppinen estimates the new cameras use about one-third less energy than the old ones, and the team also got rid of the old NVR server, leading to further energy savings. In addition, the Meraki devices are more durable than the old cameras, with a life-cycle of ten-plus years with IT support.\nAs for aesthetics, the MV cameras have a slightly bigger form factor than the old cameras, so they don\u2019t blend into the environment quite as well, but Karppinen says the difference is negligible. The Meraki system also works natively in a Mac environment, which is important for the team. One Meraki feature that surprised Karppinen was its ability to create heatmaps to count visitors and show where visitors spend the most time. \u201cIt was an interesting detail that we can benefit from in our operations to keep track of the number of visitors in different rooms of the museum,\u201d he says. \u201cThis way we can see what people are most interested in.\u201d"

    "text": "The most important thing for us was to see what is happening in the network and be able to act on it quickly. Moving to the cloud has given us a better foundation to build on.\nInformation Technology Architect at Oktober\nOktober has provided care for the elderly in the Netherlands for over 50 years. With multidisciplinary teams, they offer domestic help, emergency care, rehabilitation, and hospice for the aging population across the country.\nThe Netherlands faces a two-fold challenge, a pain point that can be found in countries around the world. Among the population, there is a problematic shortage of educated caregivers in the workforce. Meanwhile, larger numbers of people are entering retirement age. More people need care, and fewer people can provide it. This was a significant concern for Oktober, and it was complicated by a technical problem.\nIn 2015, many of Oktober\u2019s locations didn\u2019t have wireless access. Data servers were on premises and disconnected from other sites. Network switches were provided and contracted by different companies. Telephone systems had various providers, and there was an overgrowth of unconnected critical alarm equipment.\nWhen Maik Berkelmans joined Oktober, he discovered an environment where IT solutions were seen as a problem. IT was complicated. Oktober\u2019s systems were old and problematic. Most importantly, they were expensive.\nWhere others saw problems, Mr. Berkelmans saw opportunity: digital health. Oktober began a journey toward solving these challenges by making more efficient use of skilled workers\u2019 time, providing more care for those in need, and phasing out legacy systems that no longer provided the worth of their cost and upkeep.\nWhen Berkelmans connected with Cisco Meraki and Cisco Gold Partner Simac IT NL, his vision was clear. His chief requirement was that everything had to run on the same network: the digital highway. All new systems were required to integrate and work together. This need was identified by working closely with the Cisco Meraki team and delivered by the Meraki platform.\nOktober wanted to enable location services and they needed to digitalize their telephony services. All their locations needed complete Wi-Fi coverage for employees and clients and they needed to move all local servers into a cloud infrastructure. Most importantly, if they were to open their infrastructure to the internet, these connected solutions had to be secure.\nBy working in harmony, Cisco Meraki and Oktober solved the connectivity problem by linking Oktober\u2019s nine locations with primary and secondary network connections with a 4G backup. Hospitality and location sensors were installed. Using advanced wireless access points, mesh networks were fine-tuned to bring high-speed coverage to every corner of every building.\nWith reliable connectivity spread across the entire organization, Oktober adopted the Meraki dashboard to manage care and services. Employees changed from wrestling with outdated systems to using personalized tools based on their job and access levels, monitoring clients in all aspects, improving the operation of facilities, and making more efficient use of valuable time.\nIn 2022, IT is no longer a problem. Integrated networking systems are at the forefront of Oktober\u2019s strategy and vision for the future.\nInformation Technology Architect at Oktober\nThe paper-based client records previously stored locally have been replaced by digitalized records that are part of the secure cloud network. On-premises servers have been phased out in favor of cloud storage so that critical information can be accessed locally or remotely by the caregivers who need it. All the essential information needed to deliver the best care possible is available across the organization.\nEvery caregiver now has a network-connected smartphone, and the care they provide is no longer bound to a single Oktober facility. Instead, employees are provided with a location-based schedule according to where they\u2019re most needed, saving them time in transit as well as the environmental and financial costs of travel.\nWith the connected systems and clear views into all areas of their network, Oktober can identify and customize the care each client needs and feed that information directly into the employee dashboard. This enables caregivers to know what services are needed, what special circumstances may exist, and how to ensure a patient gets the best possible treatment.\nThe new system is highly secure, meeting AVG standards of security. However, Oktober has put even more safeguards in the system by controlling what information can be accessed, when, and by whom.\n\u201cIf you are scheduled at location A, then you only have insight into the client files of that location, and only for that day,\u201d says Berkelmans. \u201cYou can only see what you need to see.\u201d\nIn the upgraded system, many more clients can be remotely monitored on a 24-hour basis. Remote check-ins can be performed for less urgent issues, so caregivers spend more time with patients instead of spending time traveling from location to location. This provides a path for efficiency and sustainability as the need for care grows, while the workforce provides better care and has more visibility through multimedia connections. As for critical alarms, the IQ Messenger delivers alerts when clients need immediate help.\nAll of these systems are integrated into the same network, giving everyone involved peace of mind.\nOktober is continuing to build out their capabilities on the foundation of the stable connected network. In the near future, they will be introducing more efficiencies through process automation\u2014using data insights to optimize critical care and operational processes throughout the organization. They\u2019re also working on real-time monitoring of health via smart devices and AI solutions, like Kepler Vision, to detect and proactively monitor emergencies and behavioral changes.\nOne of the greatest strengths of the Meraki platform is the ease of integration via their robust open APIs and webhooks. The depth of their capabilities stands out in the market. This functionality allows Oktober to further optimize the caregiver digital processes and is seen as critical in the future of caregiving. In addition, the five-year Cisco Meraki Enterprise Agreement for our licenses offers additional benefits such as consumption flexibility and financial predictability.\nWhen speaking to the Meraki partnership, Berkelmans describes how he is \u201cmost proud of what we\u2019ve achieved together. You need commitment from within the organization. The management has to believe you and trust you, and you need technology partners who are willing to listen and advise the fit-for-purpose solution based on their expertise.\u201d\nTo surmise the need for connectivity in healthcare, Hein Dekkers, Director of Digital Acceleration in the Netherlands, stated, \u201cAnytime, anywhere access to healthcare is crucial. Reliable and secure connectivity for the technological solutions and systems used in healthcare is vital in this regard. The need for technology is further emphasized by the increasing demand for care and labor shortages, both to support and facilitate care workers to continue doing their work, which is their passion, and to meet the inevitable growing demand for care. We need to act now and join forces to ensure a safe and inclusive future for all. This vision has led Oktober to recognize and unlock the full potential of the much-needed digital acceleration in healthcare.\u201d"

    "text": "We see a future where commuters can share a view and see the status and timings of public transport in real time, just like administrators. \u2026 Because of Meraki, we can show the whole journey across all the modes of transit.\nSenior System Network Administrator, Brescia Mobilit\u00e0\nCreated in 2004, Brescia Mobilit\u00e0 SpA oversees all public transit in and around the historic and idyllic Italian town of Brescia.\nIn addition to managing payment and ticketing systems for commuters, Brescia Mobilit\u00e0 is responsible for the operation, upkeep, optimization, and improvement of multiple transit network systems used by more than 1,000,000 commuters per day.\nEight years ago, Brescia Mobilit\u00e0\u2019s Senior System Network Administrator, Carlo Bracchi, had what he described as an impossible challenge. Under his management were bus lines, rail lines, car sharing, bike sharing, parking management, traffic monitoring, and more\u2014all the critical components of mobility that keep a city moving.\nThe unsustainable issue from a network administrator\u2019s point of view was that all of those systems worked in silos. For a commuter, buying a bus ticket meant interacting with a single third-party system. Purchasing a rail ticket required transacting with an entirely different system. Arranging for a car share used yet another provider, and so on with each city service. The siloed systems were further complicated by the stress of an unreliable network. Dropped network connections during transactions left commuters unable to make their transit connections to get to work, school, or out for a day in the historic city.\nNetwork admins, meanwhile, had to manage a call sheet of vendors for each disparate system. No single person on staff could see or diagnose issues across all the services they used. Worse, the upkeep costs were quickly eclipsing the city\u2019s transit budget.\n\u201cIt was not possible for us to hire the people needed to manage all the different elements,\u201d said Mr. Bracchi. \u201cWe could not even think about the future because we were spending our budget and focus prioritizing which third-party consultant we had to hire to fix which system.\u201d\nWhen Bracchi began working with Cisco Meraki, he focused on the big problem first: connectivity.\nBrescia Mobilit\u00e0 and Meraki built a network of updated cables and Wi-Fi access points that stretched across all the city\u2019s transit spots. With this first step, dropped connections were practically eliminated, dramatically alleviating commuter frustration while providing administrators with full visibility into all systems.\nThe impact and success of this first step enabled Brescia Mobilit\u00e0 to begin focusing on their business goal of providing safe, streamlined, secure access to all the elements of transit. Bracchi and his team asked themselves how they could refine the system to better\nrespond to commuter needs using connectivity and data, and how they could build a network of services capable of rapidly responding to change?\nNext, Brescia Mobilit\u00e0 integrated Meraki IoT sensors and cameras into their network, gaining the ability to change and improve using data insights. A transformation began to take shape, powered by building more innovative solutions to simplify the previous overcomplicated system.\nFrom the Meraki dashboard, administrators could see where server rooms were getting too hot. They could see the HVAC impacts in crowded trains. They could get live views from cameras at stations and stops that were becoming overcrowded. It was easy to adopt and integrate all the devices into the network monitoring system because they were built to work seamlessly with their new network. The unconnected, siloed third-party systems began to be phased out.\nWe have a single dashboard now. We can see where any particular bus is. We can see when someone is lost in a parking lot. And we can see when any part of the system is down and react quickly and precisely.\nSenior System Network Administrator, Brescia Mobilit\u00e0\nWith the IoT sensors and cameras, Bracchi\u2019s team was able to quickly adopt APIs, which allowed tracking of how many people were in train stations. Those insights enabled transit managers to direct people and avoid dangerous overcrowding. They also adopted systems that tracked how many empty seats were on buses and provided that information to commuters to make informed decisions.\nAdding capabilities and services happens faster and simpler by using partners like Project Informatica, which is part of the Meraki network\u2014service providers that bring solutions that are ready to be integrated into the network and the Meraki dashboard. The continued unification of systems means Bracchi\u2019s staff spends less time fixing the past and more time working on the future."

    "text": "With a simple aim to ensure the best possible quality of life for people with disabilities, \u2018s Heeren Loo (sHL) is a key component of the Dutch healthcare system. It is a leader in critical care for people with intellectual disabilities, and it helps people young and old with intellectual and other needs across the country to live how they want with people who are important to them.\nDrawing on over 130 years of knowledge and practical experience combined with the latest scientific research and innovations, sHL\u2019s mission is to help people move forward. This is, however, a highly intensive process: 16,000 sHL employees provide care for 14,000 clients.\nWherever possible, sHL wants to treat clients in their home environment. It also manages 800 care facilities and homes throughout the Netherlands, ranging from six-room apartment blocks to village-like campuses housing 200 to more than 600 clients. It is complex work, involving the coordination of clinicians, psychologists, caseworkers, volunteers, and the wider healthcare system.\n\u201cThere has been a shift towards care in a community setting, but we also need to provide residential care,\u201d explains Guido van Baal, information manager, infrastructure, at sHL. \u201cIt means we have a varied, constantly changing estate.\u201d\nThe sHL real estate team manages around 1000 properties throughout the country. Sustainability, in addition to suitability for clients, plays an important role in new facilities and across its network.\nsHL recognizes that digital solutions will transform healthcare delivery, providing touchpoints to enable the remote monitoring of smart homes. This will improve both client safety and productivity; the more efficient sHL becomes, the better it can support its hard-working teams and the more people it can treat. However, sHL needs first to establish a consistent network infrastructure for digital transformation to take place.\n\u201cWe need to put the network foundations in first,\u201d says van Baal. \u201cAs we deliver standardized care, we also need a standardized approach to the network.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the first step in the journey,\u201d he adds. The goal is for sHL to be better able to explore innovation in the healthcare sector. \u201cIn providing care for our clients, we need a solid and simple network infrastructure that is available to those who need it and flexible for introducing new concepts that can take us further,\u201d says van Baal. \u201cWe want to actively test new ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn providing care for our clients, we need a solid and simple network infrastructure that is available to those who need it and flexible for actively testing new concepts that can take us further. The engagement with Cisco enables us to look at new ideas in a controlled environment.\u201d\nIn providing care for our clients, we need a solid and simple network infrastructure that is available to those who need it and flexible for actively testing new concepts that can take us further. The engagement with Cisco enables us to look at new ideas in a controlled environment.\nInformation Manager, Infrastructure\nsHL\u2019s future network is being built on a secure, integrated cloud network infrastructure based on Cisco Meraki and Axians Network as a Service (NaaS). It creates a consistent, LAN, WAN, and wireless LAN (WLAN) based on standardized components, managed centrally using one dashboard.\nLong term, this establishes a roadmap to Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), giving users across all applications a consistent experience by uniting networking and security in the cloud.\n\u201cThe Cisco/Axians approach is a significant change for the business. It means we see infrastructure as our connectivity backbone, based on state-of-the-art and fit-for-purpose solutions, in service to the business. We\u2019re less tied to the technology, and more focused on the business outcomes. Technology is not the core focus of the organization; that is providing care,\u201d says van Baal.\n\u201cThis cultural shift,\u201d he continues, \u201cwas helped by bringing Cisco to the table alongside sHL senior management. Other vendors tended to focus on the technology; Cisco was able to elevate the conversation and share its expertise of the local and global healthcare industry.\u201d\nThe Cisco proposal included a proof of concept at sHL\u2019s Apeldoorn location, testing the Cisco Meraki cloud management platform and a host of different applications and device connections. Axians then helped create templates for three sizes of sHL care locations. The templates allow for a degree of flexibility, which means sHL doesn\u2019t need to redesign a network for each location.\nsHL will first test a specific location, with Axians support on site, before rolling out across all formats. \u201cWe aim to have the rollout complete by the end of 2023,\u201d says van Baal.\nThe first major location was successfully migrated to Cisco Meraki\u00a0software-defined WAN in October 2022. Thorough planning and project management by Axians was combined with other suppliers\u2019 solutions to contribute to the continuity of care, such as care home automation, critical alarms, workplace applications, and building equipment.\nsHL also committed to a Cisco Enterprise Agreement (EA), bringing further clarity to its network strategy and providing transparency around pricing and cost predictability as the business and its network expand. \u201cOnce we committed to Cisco, the EA made practical financial sense,\u201d van Baal says. \u201cLicense clarity in line with the roll-out schedules, efficiency for our procurement team, flexibility for growth, change scenarios, and predictability on the financial impact are just a few of the benefits.\u201d\nThe network templates help to ensure the rollout will go ahead quickly and smoothly. sHL is clear what components are needed for each location; cloud management means little onsite expertise is needed. Standardized components mean standardized support.\n\u201cWe now have the fundamentals in place from which to scale,\u201d says van Baal. \u201cIt ensures we have a standard level of consistent service\u2014for end points and for users\u2014in every location.\u201d\nThis means digital touchpoints, whether tablets, environmental sensors, smart cameras, or location tags, work consistently in all sHL locations. Moreover, sHL can manage and support the network centrally, creating new levels of efficiency.\nFrom a business perspective, this approach also allows sHL to quickly integrate new acquisitions. sHL is one of the largest care providers in the Netherlands, and opportunities to absorb smaller organizations are likely. Cisco Meraki means only an internet connection is needed to bring the new location online. The Cisco Enterprise Agreement enables sHL to price the cost of a network upgrade.\nCisco\u2019s Country Digital Acceleration program has helped to maintain sHL\u2019s position at the forefront of the healthcare industry from a technological perspective. And while it is too early to make accurate statements on cost savings, van Baal says the business case shows a prospective total cost of ownership savings of 25 percent as a result of a small set of standardized network profiles to match the need of each location, versus the previous disjointed approach. This removed complexity and eased the delivery process, removing waste through the whole value chain.\nMore immediately, with the foundations in place, sHL can begin to explore new overlay technology. It has selected three \u201ctest\u201d locations to act as testing environments, where it will work with Cisco and Axians on future-oriented living for its clients. Service innovation will maintain sHL\u2019s position at the forefront of the healthcare sector.\nIt is here that Cisco\u2019s global expertise in the smart building and healthcare sectors, plus its links to third-party developers, will be most valuable. \u201cThe hope,\u201d says van Baal, \u201cis that the relationship will open doors to the latest in healthcare technology. It should also encourage sHL care teams to find and suggest their own digital ideas.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a huge desire to understand how digital transformation can create value for our clients, but we have to find use cases that scale,\u201d van Baal points out. \u201cThe \u2018test\u2019 locations, and the engagement with Cisco, will enable us to look at new ideas in a controlled environment. Cisco\u2019s experience is pragmatic but also inspirational.\u201d\nIn choosing Cisco Meraki and Axians as partners, sHL is highlighting its commitment to sustainability. Existing infrastructure is being reused or recycled, and new equipment is received in packaging with minimal carbon footprints.\nThe new Meraki infrastructure\u2019s low power consumption enables sHL to meet energy-saving targets, while other built-in features enable further reductions. These measures not only positively impact sHL\u2019s sustainability initiatives, but they also reduce total cost of ownership.\n\u201cOur traditional ways of sourcing gave us standard solutions and services,\u201d says van Baal. \u201cChanging the process by having Cisco at the table as a technology partner opened our eyes. Cisco and Axians were focused, challenged sHL, and contributed value throughout the process.\u201d"

    "text": "\nThe International School Carinthia (ISC) Velden in Austria serves a student population of over 380 students representing 41 nationalities and speaking 34 languages. The modern campus, located in the market town of Velden with a backdrop of the picturesque W\u00f6rthersee Lake, consists of two buildings containing 21 classrooms, two gyms, a lab, library, media center, and music room.\nPriding itself as a technology-forward environment, ISC Velden has embarked on a journey toward the future of education\u2014a future built on connectivity, collaboration, and accessibility through reliable digital learning.\nISC is striving to be a leader in technology-based education, and the Meraki platform works hand-in-hand with that goal.\nFormer Director of ISC\nWith approximately 450 network users connecting over 800 devices on a daily basis, an exceptional network is vital for ISC\u2019s success in delivering an elevated digital learning experience.\nBoth students and staff rely on connectivity for their daily learning, online collaboration, and communication. The school took a learning-by-doing approach and discovered their existing network wasn\u2019t \u201cfuture ready.\u201d Instead, it was leading to a variety of poor experiences, both from students voicing concern over dropped Wi-Fi as well as significant IT service costs due to the lack of adaptability and flexibility of the network.\nISC desperately needed a technology partner that could provide a solution to address connectivity and IT management needs, especially with the school\u2019s BYOD (bring your own device) policy that required an added layer of device management, access, and visibility. They needed a network that was equally reliable, stable, and flexible to support all connected devices while allowing for automated updates. Security and network health were also top of mind when finding the right partner, with both students and parents contributing and communicating on a variety of school-related websites and applications.\nJames Brightman, former Director of ISC, was \u201cvery thankful\u201d when the school\u2019s IT provider recommended Meraki as a modern, flexible answer to their connectivity, security, and adaptability woes.\nIn their journey toward award-winning digital learning, the ISC technology team agreed a cloud-managed architecture could further facilitate their mission as it allows for the agility and flexibility they had previously been lacking. The cloud-managed nature of the Meraki platform allows for network-wide visibility, which leads to a drastic reduction in reactive troubleshooting and an increase in predictive network management, giving the school\u2019s IT team vital time back. Another benefit: with Meraki, the ISC IT team has visibility into the status of each technology solution through one centralized \u201caccessible from anywhere\u201d dashboard.\nISC\u2019s school network now consists of 30 Meraki MR access points, three MS switches, and two MX SD-WAN appliances, all of which address not only the connectivity issues the school had been experiencing but their security fears as well. The MX SD-WAN allows ISC to control how traffic is directed and prioritized across multiple uplinks while enabling the school\u2019s network to immediately and intelligently adapt to changing performance conditions.\nTechnology is a tool to help students learn, and when it\u2019s running smoothly without more dedicated time from our side, we are able to focus on what our true job is: providing a 21st century educational program to our kids.\nFormer Director of ISC\nLet\u2019s take a step back to highlight what a future-ready learning environment actually looks like. A future-ready classroom is one without walls, one that provides equitable connectivity, secure digital experiences, and an emphasis on a collaboration from anywhere approach.\nLena Aspmair, a student at ISC, describes digitalization in her school as a way to \u201ccollaborate faster and more efficiently with others.\u201d Through the partnership with Meraki and the subsequent improved connectivity, she goes on to note, \u201cwe can collaborate so much more easily with our classmates and our teachers\u2014and [that collaboration] prepares us for life after school.\u201d\nBecause of the cloud-managed nature of Meraki solutions, the students aren\u2019t the only ones benefiting from the results of the partnership. Since the system can be managed remotely via the Meraki dashboard,  the school was able to realize cost savings since they don\u2019t need engineers on-site to troubleshoot or implement updates. In addition, there has been a significant reduction in service tickets, which means that staff can focus on their true mission: continuing to provide a future-ready approach to learning for their students."

    "text": "Because there were so many different services working together, it is a complex network, so it had to be very clear to us what is connected where.\nIT Manager, Stad Menen\nMenen is a city and municipality in Belgium, located about 65 miles west of Brussels on the border with France. Stad Menen (\u201cstad\u201d means \u201ccity\u201d in Dutch) has a population of nearly 35,000. The municipality comprises the city of Menen proper and the towns of Lauwe and Rekkem.\nStad Menen needed a citywide refresh of its network, which consisted of a patchwork of legacy components that were at least seven years old, resulting in slow performance, unreliability, and cumbersome management. With more and more applications moving to the cloud, both residents and city employees needed more bandwidth and better connectivity to access digital services faster and enjoy a better application experience. With the city government spread across 22 locations and employing 850 workers, the project promised to be a major undertaking.\nAt the same time, the city built a brand new public service center in Lauwe that placed new demands on the network. The building, named Het Applauws, housed a variety of functions, including a local police department that needed bandwidth for security cameras and other operations, a fully automated library with no human presence at the desk, several meeting rooms, a large concert hall, a caf\u00e9, an internet radio station, and more. In addition to its present-day needs, the city wanted a network that could handle greater demands and new projects in the future.\nIn 2019, after the city contracted with a partner via an RFP process, the decision was made to use the Het Applauws building\u2014which was not yet built at the time\u2014as a POC. Following an extensive site survey, a blueprint was developed that would not only serve as a basis for Het Applauws, but also for other implementations at key city locations and in future buildings. Top priorities for Jeroen Lannoo, Stad Menen\u2019s IT Manager, were standardization and streamlining. A new member of the IT team had previously worked with Meraki, and the decision was made to implement a Meraki solution in the new building as a POC.\n\u201cThe building was perfect for a POC because it represented a lot of functions where we could see the added value of Meraki components,\u201d Lannoo said.\nThe team initially installed a high-availability firewall solution consisting of two Meraki MX security appliances, about 25 Meraki MR access points, and several cloud-managed Meraki MS PoE switches with 24 and 48 ports. Based on the success of the POC implementation, the team chose Meraki for the rest of the refresh and began rolling out a citywide rip-and-replace strategy. Eventually, the team implemented an augmented MPLS connection with SD-WAN and layer-3 switching for better management of the network across the various locations. During the pandemic, they also implemented Microsoft 365 for all city employees.\nToday, the city of Menen is experiencing the benefits of cloud managed networking, a secure and open architecture that accelerates and simplifies network operations. The high-performance local network is stable, flexible, and easy to manage, enabling more tasks to be performed in less time and at lower cost. The solution established interconnectivity without the use of VPN clients or the legacy, slow MPLS network, as well as decentral internet connectivity due to local breakout per building instead of passing over the MPLS to one central breakout. Guest users at the POC building enjoy better and faster connectivity.\nEasier monitoring and management are key benefits for the city\u2019s small IT team, which consists of one IT manager, a system administrator, a part-time admin, and one full-time GIS coordinator. The cloud-first architecture eliminates repetitive tasks around network configuration, freeing up time for the IT team to focus on higher-value tasks and empowering them to make more informed decisions about the network based on detailed analytics.\nWith the simplicity of cloud-based management via the Meraki dashboard, troubleshooting is easier and more streamlined. In the legacy environment, which lacked a central management tool, troubleshooting required IT workers to use complicated command-line interface (CLI) processes. But with the intuitive web interface of Meraki, lesser-skilled help desk engineers who lack CLI expertise can make small changes to device configurations and help with troubleshooting. The IT team has seen a 50% decrease in network issues and spends less time overall on troubleshooting, setup, and installation\u2014nearly half.\nThe dashboard also boosts security\u2014for example, by making it possible to send updates to devices. It\u2019s also accessible from anywhere, allowing the IT team to handle tickets, configure devices or switches, and run cable checks remotely without having to travel to any of the city\u2019s 22 locations. The team reports more than 50% reduction in on-site travel to deal with networking issues.\n\u201cThe web interface and logging also make for better security insights,\u201d Lannoo said.\nDue to budgetary restrictions, the citywide network refresh is still being rolled out in stages, but the goal is to standardize all 22 locations on the same setup and eventually move everything to the cloud because of the value, simplicity, and ease of management it delivers."

    "text": "A one-year subscription to Rolling Stone magazine\u2014that was the top prize for the first video game tournament that took place back in 1972. From those humble beginnings, electronic sports\u2014or esports\u2014have become a global phenomenon, with over 550 million players competing daily in a variety of online games.\nAs the world of esports continues to expand, collegiate esports is experiencing similar growth with the help of outside organizations like the National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE), which offers membership to more than 170 colleges and universities with their own esports leagues.\nOne of the colleges paving their way toward an esports legacy is Ottawa University (OU) in Kansas which, in partnership with Chief Technology Officer Adam Caylor, is pioneering a new era of collegiate esports.\nPowered by an advanced Meraki network, the OU team transformed a theatre built in 1906 into a modern esports arena. The wired and wireless experiences are optimized through the intelligent, AI-powered Meraki platform, enabling rapid response and delivering lightning-fast network speeds.\nWhile a majority of college esports teams use existing classrooms or dorm spaces with limited capacity for their practices and competitions, Caylor was thinking outside the lines, or in this case, outside the classroom walls, for OU\u2019s future in esports. We\u2019re talking full-scale arena status. The solution? Peters Auditorium, a school theatre built 100 years ago that was slowly collecting cobwebs.\nCaylor, a self-proclaimed gamer, combined his interest in the sport with his expertise in technology to lead the theatre\u2019s transformation toward a next-level gaming experience.\nConverting a theatre built in the 1900s to a tournament-ready arena came with a unique set of challenges. Beyond the superficial updates\u2014like new paint, flooring, and walls\u2014technology in the theatre was essentially nonexistent, so Caylor and his team needed to get the space connected.\nMuch like a football team needs a field complete with goalposts, scoreboards, and referees, the OU Braves esports arena required a space with gamer-ready technology and support. Caylor and his team wanted to create a space with the bandwidth required to connect the esports student athletes and hundreds of concurrent fans. That meant a reliable, secure LAN for gamers participating in tournaments. It also required the highest-performance Wi-Fi connection for the fans watching live who wanted to engage and participate, while also giving IT the ability to monitor connections and bandwidth.\nThe arena needed to be multi-use as well, fulfilling the needs of a lecture hall and classroom during the day and an event and gaming space in the evening. This required a dynamic solution that could provide multiple types of connectivity and support a wide array of end user experiences.\nWe were really reinventing the wheel here with what student engagement looks like\u2014and Meraki was able to help build the foundation for this new channel of engagement.\nChief Technology Officer at Ottawa University\nOU was already a full-stack user of Cisco Meraki products. Having seen the successes of other Meraki solutions on campus, Caylor decided to connect the theatre using Meraki MR access points and MS switches. The space would need to support 100 people at a time, including both student athletes and spectators. This meant OU needed high-capacity MR access points to ensure the best possible Wi-Fi experience for fans to engage with their favorite players (looking up gaming history and Twitch stats), as well as for students using the arena as a classroom during the day.\nOU uses the MS switches installed in the arena, along with a secure MX appliance at the edge, to separate the esports traffic from the rest of the network and optimize the connection. This same infrastructure also manages and prioritizes traffic from the PCs that gamers use to compete on stage.\nAlong with reliability, security and segmentation are also top of mind. A very real threat in esports is unapproved players or online users who attempt to disrupt events, join the network, and/or affect the competition in a way they shouldn\u2019t. This puts the security of other players and viewers at risk, while also creating potential for lagging and crashes\u2014not ideal for any gamer.\nThe OU esports theatre relies on multiple network segments, dividing administration, student access, A/V, and of course, the esports network.\nThe fears around these threats were greatly eased with Meraki secure SD-WAN technology and WIPS capabilities that monitor the wireless LAN networks for rogue access points and other wireless threats, providing an added layer of security. While the arena has yet to experience any issues with wireless intrusion, Caylor \u201chas comfort knowing that they are covered by Meraki security.\u201d\nThe nature of the Meraki solution being as flexible, dynamic, and scalable as it is\u2014it allowed us to turn on a dime.\nChief Technology Officer at Ottawa University\nWhen in use as the Ottawa Braves esports arena, the space now serves as the backdrop for a wide variety of tournaments. The Braves have gone on to win multiple national championships and are amping up for a new season of competition under the guidance of their very own director of esports, Alex Madera.\nThis is just the start for the Braves. Between their connected OU arena and the esports space at their Surprise, Arizona, campus (also powered by Meraki), they are quickly building their own community of fans and gamers who can engage in-person and virtually thanks to the Meraki network.\nThe Meraki dashboard provides Caylor and his growing IT team with immediate 24/7 visibility into the health of the access points, switches, and the esports network as a whole, allowing them to monitor competitions and practices from anywhere, anytime. Caylor views the dashboard as an \u201cintegral part of the IT team.\u201d From the help desk doing troubleshooting, engineering, deploying networks, even digital media broadcasting and measuring network latency and connection issues during a broadcast\u2014the dashboard \u201cmakes sure everything is working.\u201d\nAs the OU esports league continues to expand, the arena is set to host larger competitions and Caylor is excited to utilize the flexibility of Meraki Health to manage metrics and monitor bandwidth peaks and access. The intelligent, AI-powered Meraki Health service provides a new level of insight and assurance that supercharges the performance of the esports network and helps OU provide a best-in-class gaming experience.\nLooking to the future of collegiate esports, colleges may find that prioritizing the building of esports communities and dedicated facilities can pay off in student recruitment efforts. Not only that, but student athletes on scholarship who acquire an injury that prevents them from playing in their physical sport can seek a new resolve in the esports community.\nCaylor sums up his role in the University\u2019s esports legacy as saying that although he isn\u2019t the one coaching or playing the games, he feels pride in knowing that the team and the games they play are powered by his hard work\u2014and Meraki."

    "text": "Nestled in the rolling hills of northern California, Saint Mary\u2019s College of California offers students a diverse curriculum, from the humanities and sciences to education and business administration. The private Catholic college invites students, faculty, and staff from different social, economic, and cultural backgrounds to come together and share their faith and quest for knowledge.\nWhile the campus is set in stunning surroundings, connectivity can be a challenge. Even electricity is at risk if power lines in the canyon fail. And over 3,000 students expect super-fast broadband on multiple devices, both at school and in their halls of residence. The college also hosts events at its conference center and outreach programs in the community, which creates an additional pressure to provide fast, secure Wi-Fi on demand.\nSaint Mary\u2019s College needs highly available Wi-Fi around the clock. It\u2019s currently upgrading its network from Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6, and the team responsible for maintaining it is self-confessed \u201cteam of one,\u201d Jim M., Network Systems Manager.\nThe college runs a corporate network for staff and faculty and provides housing for students living on campus. It also needs to balance giving users a secure browsing experience with the academic freedom to access a wide range of content.\nAs if that wasn\u2019t complicated enough, many of the school\u2019s buildings are mixed use, with academic floors in the basement and dorm rooms or classrooms upstairs\u2014all with different network requirements. Following the pandemic, classrooms need networks that support both connected devices and live streaming for remote viewers.\nConcrete walls containing wire mesh can also disrupt Wi-Fi signals. While the college tried to get around this by deploying more access points, hitting the sweet spot is a delicate balance. Too many access points can even make the situation worse and cause issues with interference.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to provide great Wi-Fi in buildings that are nearly 100 years old, especially when students are expecting Wi-Fi 6,\u201d Jim commented.\nWhen the college deployed Cisco Meraki access points to its halls of residence, service desk calls relating to Wi-Fi and Ethernet dropped dramatically. Naturally, when Meraki proposed an early evaluation of next-generation access points for high-density areas, Jim jumped at the chance to roll out future-proof technology that supports Wi-Fi 6 E.\nThe solution also guarantees no interference with 6 GHz channels, which provides a cleaner air space and mitigates issues caused by the wire mesh in the walls.\nNew access points have been deployed in the library, gym, and convention center, giving visitors and members of the college community significantly higher bandwidth and greater stability. The plug-and-play setup makes the access points incredibly fast and easy to deploy.\nWalled garden environments, which control access to network-based content and services during public events, can be set up in just a few clicks to protect sensitive data while ensuring guests still enjoy fast Wi-Fi.\nFor an IT infrastructure team of one, cloud-based management has been a game-changer. Regular alerts provide up-to-date notifications of any outages or issues for a quick response.\nEase of use also means the college can enlist extra help to install units with minimal training\u2014something Jim feels is synonymous with all Meraki products. As for maintenance, the Meraki dashboard allows updates and fixes to be scheduled to coincide with student vacations to cause the least disruption.\nSaint Mary\u2019s College is also using Meraki Air Marshal to increase security. It allows the team to protect the airspace from wireless attacks and resolve threats before they risk impacting the network.\nThe Meraki dashboard makes managing the network so simple, I can quickly respond to issues even while I am off campus.\nNetwork Systems Manager, Saint Mary\u2019s College of California\nSince deploying Meraki access points, Saint Mary\u2019s College has the stable network it needs to support research and learning and accelerate community outreach.\nNot only did Jim rate it \u201ca very pleasant deployment experience,\u201d but complaints regarding slow internet have greatly been reduced.\nResource-intensive applications for video conferencing and live streaming are also running smoothly, even during peak times. And in this case, no news from users is good news\u2015achieving the golden standard of technology \u201cthat just works.\u201d\nThe cloud-based dashboard makes it a breeze to manage and maintain the network, which means the college doesn\u2019t need a separate support contract\u2015although Meraki support is always available when needed.\nGoing forward, the college is rolling out more Meraki access points to high-density spaces. An additional 200 Meraki switches, which are optimized for hospitality, are to be deployed in its halls of residence. Students are also looking forward to better connectivity in the library, especially during the busy finals period.\nFurther into the deployment, the tri-band channels 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz will allow students with higher-end devices to connect to 6 GHz, reducing traffic across the other two channels. Lower latency means all devices and resource-intensive applications will perform better, creating a more positive overall user experience.\nSince deploying Meraki access points, our complaints regarding slow Wi-Fi have been greatly reduced.\nNetwork Systems Manager, Saint Mary\u2019s College of California"

    "text": "ESBO Logistics is a multi-client logistics operator with more than 65,000 m2 of storage facilities spread over two logistics centers, and present across numerous sectors such as food, pharmaceuticals, industry, and commerce.\nESBO considered a complete overhaul of its network infrastructure. The objectives were to have the right architecture in place to guarantee the smooth operation of the entire company and to be able to provide solutions for the future and help customers face new market challenges in their respective business sectors.\nGrowing the facilities has also involved creating an automated vertical warehouse, with metal racks (for the subsequent challenge of wireless coverage) over 11 m high and 60,000 product storage bins\u2014almost 250,000 stock locations.\nIn order to meet the new challenges posed by both e-commerce and logistics, ESBO needed to have an up-to-date, robust, flexible, scalable, and secure IT infrastructure. It needed an infrastructure that would provide the foundation to adopt new advanced logistics solutions that would also be simple to manage.\nESBO wanted to pursue the latest technology and innovation as an added value for its customers. This led the company to consider implementing new robotic technologies to automate the warehousing and distribution processes.\n\u201cWe have an obligation to ensure our systems are secure and don\u2019t fail at any time. We are very aware that our work is vital for our customers\u2019 businesses. We cannot afford for it to stop, which is why we are working with Cisco and Cisco Meraki,\u201d says Joan Gormedino, ESBO\u2019s Director of People, Quality, and Compliance.\nWe have always looked for technological solutions that ensure stability, and this is why we have always turned to Cisco.\nDirector of People, Quality, and Compliance, ESBO Logistics\nWorking with stable and flexible solutions\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing ESBO Logistics excels at, it is flexibility,\u201d says Joan Gormedino. \u201cAnd to be flexible, you have to make significant investments in technology. On the one hand, at ESBO we have developed our own management system, which already has a track record of more than 30 years of innovation, and in which we have invested our knowledge of the market, allowing us to be flexible in a fast and effective way. On the other hand, having stable systems is also necessary. This is why we have always looked for technological solutions that ensure stability, and for this, we have always turned to Meraki and its partner, Datacom.Global, with whom we have worked for over ten years.\u201d\nIn 2017, ESBO decided to undergo a technological revolution and change the entire network infrastructure by implementing a Cisco Meraki full-stack network solution. This solution provides the connectivity needed to support the demands of an ever-growing market in an environment such as logistics services that is driven by e-commerce and changing consumer habits.\nThis renovation required a redundant infrastructure linking the company\u2019s headquarters to the two warehouses via SD-WAN. With this, ESBO guaranteed seamless connectivity with zero downtime, offering the maximum quality of service for all applications as well as global management through a single centralized control panel managed from the cloud.\nThe Meraki infrastructure has allowed us to implement state-of-the-art robotic technology to automate the warehousing and distribution processes without any capacity nor service problems.\nDirector of People, Quality, and Compliance, ESBO Logistics\nAn exceptional communication experience with Wi-Fi 6\nTaking into account the unique characteristics of ESBO\u2019s facilities, and based on the advice of Datacom.Global and Cisco Meraki, a coverage study was conducted to analyze the various challenges. Examples of these challenges include the conditions of cold rooms used to store certain materials and the heights of the metal racks. Any problem or situation was resolved using the new Wi-Fi 6 wireless technology, which provides an exceptional communication experience as well as higher speeds, and the possibility of creating intelligent spaces with the integration of IoT sensors.\nSASE, the future of security\nSecurity is also a key element in the new Cisco Meraki solution. Cisco Umbrella is the first line of defense against internet threats regardless of where users are located. Cisco Umbrella is a solution at the core of Cisco\u2019s SASE architecture that, combined with SD-WAN, enables ESBO to comply with security policies on devices that connect to the enterprise network, as well as those that connect remotely.\nCisco Umbrella is natively integrated into the Meraki control panel, making it possible to view network behavior from a single management dashboard. Unifying the visualization of the different technologies from a single point is essential, not only because it simplifies technology management, but also because of the numerous devices in the facilities that are managed (such as scanning guns, cameras, sensors, robots, etc.), as well as the increase in remote working and its associated challenges.\n\u201cMeraki\u2019s infrastructure has allowed us to implement state-of-the-art robotic technology to automate the warehousing and distribution processes without any capacity or service problems,\u201d acknowledges Joan Gormedino. \u201cWe have a fleet of robots working 24 hours a day, capable of moving in three dimensions, reaching any point on the shelves and accessing all the containers. We can now prepare orders accurately and on time, which means optimizing resources, both in terms of preparation and space. With these robots, we can handle more than 6,000 orders per day. The robots have also helped us reduce space by 50%, and we have achieved energy savings of 70% as an alternative to other technologies.\u201d\nAn extensive and complementary ecosystem\n\u201cWe have an obligation to ensure our systems are secure and don\u2019t fail at any time. We are very aware that our work is vital for our customers\u2019 businesses. We cannot afford for it to stop, which is why we are working with Meraki and Datacom,\u201d says Joan Gormedino.\nThe broad Meraki ecosystem allows ESBO to move forward clearly on its road map, responding to new needs that may arise or to the expansion of current operations. Along these lines, ESBO has started testing other components, such as Meraki cameras (to improve process automation and physical security) and Meraki environmental IoT sensors (to alert in the event of temperature changes that endanger sensitive products, detect water leaks in case of floods, and analyze air quality). And everything is always managed from the cloud, reducing operational costs by using the same network and operating from the same dashboard.\nQuality and service\n\u201cOur experience with Cisco Meraki and Datacom has always been excellent. It is fantastic. Not only have they always offered us great product quality, but great service as well,\u201d acknowledges Joan Gormedino. \u201cAs a company, we like our customers to value good service, and we look for that same level of service excellence from our suppliers.\u201d"

    "text": "Hello Sunshine is a mission-driven media business. Its aim is to find, create, and publish content with women at the center of the story.\nFounded in 2016 by Reese Witherspoon, the company recognizes that if it is to change the narrative for women, it must do things differently than the mainstream. Hello Sunshine is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, and has built a reputation for creating platform-defining projects and award-winning series and films. Its content is multimedia by design, spanning film, TV, podcasts, and social.\nThe approach is working. Hello Sunshine content has already garnered 18 Emmy nominations. In 2021, Time magazine ranked Hello Sunshine to be one of the world\u2019s most influential companies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a pretty unique organization,\u201d says Sarah Oxman, Senior Director of Operations, Hello Sunshine. \u201cWe look at things differently. We\u2019re DIYers and problem solvers. It\u2019s unlike most places I\u2019ve worked.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s initial, office-based workstyle was similar to most media businesses. Work centered around the office, creative meetings were face-to-face, and there would be all-hands meetings, with attendees physically present, to start each week.\n\u201cWe were not a company that liked the idea of hybrid working. We didn\u2019t want the team working remotely,\u201d Oxman admits, \u201cand then COVID happened.\u201d\nIn less than two years, Hello Sunshine has transformed its workplace culture. It has embraced the advantages of hybrid work to build an environment that is more inclusive, creative, and agile\u2014all in the service of creating and promoting content with women at the heart.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that Hello Sunshine is made up of an amazing group of people,\u201d Oxman says. \u201cI think the last two years have demonstrated our ability to adapt and change. We\u2019ve not just survived, we\u2019ve flourished.\u201d\nHello Sunshine is made up of an amazing group of people. I think the last two years have demonstrated our ability to adapt and change. We\u2019ve not just survived, we\u2019ve flourished. Hybrid work is flexible and enables our high-performing teams, but it does not require 12-hour days and an always-on work culture.\nSenior Director of Operations\nAt Hello Sunshine, hybrid work means agile working. It also demands secure workflows.\n\u201cWe have all the usual security issues of an average business, plus the particular demands of the media industry and the unique challenges that come with having a close association with a high-profile figure,\u201d says Damien Clark, CEO of Feedwire, providers of IT services to Hello Sunshine. \u201cWe have targeted attacks.\u201d\nSecure, hybrid work at Hello Sunshine is built on Cisco Meraki and Cisco Umbrella solutions. Specifically, it includes Meraki Wi-Fi 6 access points and switching, MX250 cloud-managed security, SD-WAN appliance, and Umbrella. This establishes enterprise-grade security, capacity, performance, and Layer 7 application visibility.\n\u201cWe were able to close two old offices and open a new office with less than a zero-touch deployment,\u201d says Clark. \u201cMeraki meant we could install the network before it was deployed. It was negative touch.\u201d With Umbrella, Hello Sunshine was able to simplify and streamline its cloud security, so team members are protected no matter where they work.\n\u201cImproving security without increasing friction is the game, and it\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d says Clark. Umbrella provides Hello Sunshine with visibility across all remote or on-site devices, ports, and cloud services. This visibility and protection against phishing and malware attacks allows the Hello Sunshine team to be creative\u2014with their data fully protected.\nIn addition, the new Los Angeles head office is fitted with Cisco Meraki MV22 cloud-managed smart cameras as well as MT10 and MT20 environmental sensors. As part of its industry security commitments for the protection of intellectual property, Hello Sunshine must ensure the doors in and out of its server rooms and post-production suites are monitored 24/7.\n\u201cThe Meraki cameras are an ideal option for us,\u201d says Clark. \u201cWe can control the cameras remotely; there is much less risk of them being hacked, and with the storage contained within the camera, they are quicker and easier for to us to deploy.\u201d\nMeeting industry security requirements is a practical prerequisite, but the cameras have already made a noticeable impact, says Oxman: \u201cWe have one in the CEO\u2019s office. We spotted a water leak coming from the ceiling, via a camera feed to a mobile, and we were able to fix the problem and swap out the rug without anyone noticing.\u201d\nHello Sunshine has tripled its headcount since early 2020, up from 30 employees to more than 130. The mission remains the same, but the workstyle has been transformed.\nHybrid work has now untethered project teams from the Los Angeles office. All-hands meetings are no longer strictly in-person. \u201cWe might have 100 people in the room and 50 people dialing in,\u201d says Oxman. \u201cThere is a lot more attention on how remote teams present. As a business we have a lot more going on.\u201d\nWork is underway to expand the Nashville office, with a second office in New York operational and a fourth location\u2014likely to be London\u2014in the plans. \u201cWe have projects ongoing all round the world, with many different deadlines. Our unscripted content division is growing, as are our direct-to-consumer offerings; we\u2019re working with lots of brands,\u201d Oxman says.\nHybrid work allows the business to extend its reach beyond Los Angeles. It is key to Hello Sunshine\u2019s ability to access new talent outside of the traditional media hotspots. \u201cTechnology enables greater diversity of thought as we can recruit untapped voices and reach multitudes of audiences,\u201d says Vice President of Human Resources Hilary Straw.\nWomen worldwide were adversely impacted, in terms of career, home life, and health, by the pandemic. A diversity of talent will help Hello Sunshine find, tell, and promote women-focused stories.\n\u201cAt the core of our mission is the belief in authentic authorship,\u201d says Zoe Fairbourn, Head of Partnerships. \u201cThis means that the writers, directors, and talent we work with to bring that story to life need to represent diversity in voices.\u201d\n\u201cOur leadership team has been very good at setting a new culture and supporting people\u2019s choice of workstyle,\u201d Oxman adds. \u201cHybrid work is flexible and enables our high-performing teams, but it does not require 12-hour days and an always-on work culture.\u201d\nThe business can flex in order to accommodate project demands. Clark says the Cisco engagement creates a platform for an agile business. The Feedwire network team can provision new locations without leaving Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019re able to support networks where we don\u2019t have boots on the ground,\u201d he says. \u201cAs much as I love Nashville, people want their problems solved faster than I can fly there. Cisco Meraki cloud management means I can be on site virtually a lot faster than being there physically.\n\u201cWith Cisco Umbrella, I feel secure knowing that we\u2019re protected against malicious domains, IP addresses, and cloud applications before a connection is ever established.\u201d\nTime and effort saved are resources that can be directed into user support, Clark adds: \u201cHybrid has changed tech support. As much as Hello Sunshine is made up of problem solvers, tech support is no longer 9-to-5. People expect system availability 24/7. And managing all of our networking devices, cameras, security, and clients from the same dashboard is a huge time saver for our limited IT resources.\n\u201cIt is imperative we have a reliable network. It\u2019s good to know we have, in Cisco, a partner we can lean on.\u201d"

    "text": "\nQDOBA Mexican Eats\u202fis a fast-casual Mexican restaurant based in San Diego, California, with more than\u202f740\u202flocations across the U.S. and Canada. The company recently opened its first restaurant in Puerto Rico and is growing its franchise base in a variety of key markets across North America.\nCommitted to bringing flavor to people\u2019s lives, QDOBA uses ingredients freshly prepared in-house by hand throughout the day\u202fto create delicious menu options. While it\u2019s all about flavor at QDOBA, fast, reliable connectivity is also critical for driving the quality of the guest experience, whether paying for their meal, swiping a rewards card, or ordering online through one of the company\u2019s delivery partners.\nFor the past several years, QDOBA outsourced its entire network\u2014across all of its restaurant locations\u2014to a third party. This legacy network used a best-of-breed approach that integrated components from multiple vendors, including access points, switches, firewalls, and Wi-Fi controllers. As QDOBA grew, the network became increasingly complex and challenging to manage\u2014and extremely inflexible. For QDOBA, this meant higher operational costs, more frequent downtime, a lower-quality guest experience, and lost revenue.\nLed by Gary Burgess, Director of Infrastructure and Security, QDOBA kicked off an initiative to replace the entire network stack with a modern, cloud-based networking solution that was easy and fast to deploy and could be centrally managed from one location. The company also wanted to bring the network in-house. By doing so, it would have the agility needed to quickly support new business and technology requirements while also regaining control of day-to-day operations and strategic technology decisions.\nQDOBA selected a full-stack Meraki network, managed in the cloud, to seamlessly connect all its restaurant locations and corporate headquarters. The company deployed Meraki MR access points for Wi-Fi connectivity in each of its restaurants, along with Meraki MS for its switching needs and Meraki MG cellular gateways to provide internet backup in the event of a primary internet failure.\nTo future-proof their network reliability and security, QDOBA combined Meraki MX SD-WAN and security services from Cisco Umbrella as the first step on its journey to a full SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) architecture. Now, the QDOBA network and security teams can proactively identify new threats and coordinate remediation across their operations in real time. As a cloud-first solution, the entire network is managed from the Meraki dashboard, which provides visibility into QDOBA\u2019s network from a single location.\nThe Meraki network implementation was fast\u2014and casual! Three months into the modernization effort, QDOBA had deployed Meraki devices in more than 150 of its restaurants, with a plan to roll it out to the remaining locations over the following months.\nThe complexity in that original solution was huge. With Meraki, that goes out the window. When we couple that with SASE, we get the benefit of having more modern network security, SSL inspection, DLP, and other pieces that we never had before.\nDirector of Infrastructure and Security\nQDOBA has realized several important benefits from the Meraki network. Because Meraki uses a well-established, framework-based approach, the planning process for transforming the QDOBA network was very quick. As Gary notes, in a traditional network buildout, this process typically takes two months or more, while the QDOBA team was able to complete its planning in just two weeks.\nOne of the biggest immediate benefits QDOBA experienced with the Meraki network was increased network uptime. This is a critical advantage for the business, as it leads to increased sales and a better experience for guests.\nWith the new Meraki network in place, QDOBA is also seeing a reduction of $300,000 per year in support costs. Just two people are required to support the new network, and when a technical issue does arise, the team can pinpoint and correct it quickly\u2014from anywhere\u2014using the Meraki dashboard. While it used to take a ten-person support team days to troubleshoot issues in the legacy network, with the Meraki network, most issues can now be corrected in a matter of minutes.\nQDOBA continues to press forward with its rollout of the Meraki solution to the remaining restaurant locations at an impressive rate of between 15 and 20 new deployments per week. For Gary and his team, the new network means greater simplicity in day-to-day operations and enhanced security and visibility into the entire network from one place. For QDOBA\u2019s guests, whether they\u2019re visiting in-person or ordering online, it means delicious fresh food and a guest experience that\u2019s second to none.\nWith Meraki, it\u2019s simple. We have three templates; we configure it in one spot, test it, and press a button\u2014and then we\u2019re done.\nDirector of Infrastructure and Security"

Their award-winning agencies work with the world\u2019s biggest companies and organisations, including 317 of the Fortune Global 500, 30 of the Dow Jones 30, 62 of the NASDAQ 100 and 61 of the FTSE 100.\nWe\u2019re embarking on a transformation journey to reimagine IT at WPP. A key element of this includes delivering on our global campus vision. To support us on this journey, we will be working in partnership with Cisco to define our connectivity vision and examine how our spaces and people work, so that we can continuously evolve our ways of working in line with our sustainability goals.\nWPP Global Chief Information Officer\n\nTransforming the world\u2019s largest marketing and communications services business\nWPP\u2019s greatest impact can be seen in the work they do for clients, which has the ability to shift the perceptions and behaviours of billions of people worldwide. With purpose becoming an increasingly important driver of future growth, WPP is focusing more and more on how it can role-model sustainable excellence across everyday operations.\nAs such, WPP wants to reimagine its workplace and supply chain.\nThe organisation is\u00a0 currently undergoing a rolling programme of transformation, which includes the delivery of a global campus vision. This ambition will see 85,000 of its employees move into at least 65 world-class, net zero campuses by the end of 2025, powered entirely by renewable electricity.\n\u201cAs we collectively move towards an increasingly digital future, IT will play a critical role in helping to turn this ambition into a reality,\u201d says Rachel Higham, WPP Global Chief Information Officer.\nReflecting on the \u2018why\u2019 that sits behind this ambition, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2013 we\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s the right thing to do, and with Cisco we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be able to get there.\u201d\nThrough the delivery of this vision, WPP will realise a 20 percent reduction in physical office space.\nThese reductions will support the group as it works to meet the carbon emission reduction targets to which it is committed, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.\nThe transformation aims to create a more agile, connected and collaborative network of companies.\n\u201cThis is a live experiment that will help us to deliver on our mission to build better futures for our people, planet, clients and communities,\u201d Higham says.\nFor WPP to maximise the impact of its campus project, it needs to create smart, flexible workspaces. It wants sensors to monitor space and energy use and to provide the option for flexible working across buildings, while also having the security and control to allow teams to test new technology.\n\nBuildings as live experiments\nAs one of the building blocks behind this transformation, Cisco\u2019s technology will play a key role in helping to deliver a seamless and sustainable connectivity experience for WPP\u2019s campus-based employees.\nCisco is also key to WPP\u2019s smart building strategy. Cisco Meraki MT sensors are helping uncover new insight across a range of environmental factors, including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and power consumption, with a goal to include air quality and other elements.\nThis insight informs new efficiencies, accelerates innovation and helps meet the WPP\u2019s sustainability targets.\n\u201cThe more data we have, the more knowledge we generate, and the more insight we can respond to,\u201d says Colin Macgadie, Chief Creative Officer at BDG, architects of the smart campuses, and a WPP company.\nWPP will use its campuses as \u201clive experiments\u201d, Macgadie explains. The design of new buildings will be informed by the experience of previous offices; each building itself is designed to be flexible enough to continuously adapt to local demands.\n\u201cSensors mean we can break down the building zone-by-zone. Data can tell us which parts of the building are being used and we can use observational analysis to learn how the space is being used,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need change to be meaningful and measurable.\u201d\nIdeally, at least half the space at each campus will be shared space \u2013 cafes, meeting rooms and lounge areas, where employees from different agencies will be encouraged to meet, mingle and collaborate.\n\u201cCreativity is often about finding a fresh perspective,\u201d Macgadie adds. \u201cThe design should encourage employees to move around the building, finding spaces in which they enjoy working. We don\u2019t need people to be seated at one desk all day. Our buildings should support a healthy way of working.\u201d\nWe all need to do our part to ensure a healthy planet for future generations and there has never been a better\u00a0time to seize the opportunities before us. At WPP we\u2019re\u00a0determined to do our very best and are excited to partner\u00a0with Cisco who is supporting us to not only meet, but\u00a0exceed, our sustainability targets \u2013 inspiring our clients\u00a0to realise their potential too.\nWPP Global Chief Information Officer\nBringing together global talent\nThe Cisco engagement underpins a WPP that is collaborative, more flexible and able to deliver at scale. Increasingly, WPP is being asked to assemble multi-agency pitches or client servicing teams \u2013 the versatility of the new campuses and the smart technology that they provide will better enable this.\nWorkplace mobility will allow multi-agency project teams to assemble on campus or online; the physical space can be quickly reconfigured for new business pitches or client meetings. If there is long-term empty floorspace, WPP can lease the space to tenants or clients, with a complete office-as-a-service.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be constantly examining how our spaces and our people work. The Cisco network gives us the flexibility to continuously adapt,\u201d says Higham.\nThe new London campus features \u2018dancing walls\u2019, portable space dividers with wireless technology embedded, that can be moved to create new spaces. Other walls feature\u00a0\u2018wormholes\u2019, always-on video links, that connect to teams in WPP offices elsewhere in the world.\n\u201cIt is technology in the service of collaboration,\u201d explains Cameron. \u201cWe want to encourage cross-pollination across agencies, teams and locations.\u201d\nLocal autonomy also extends to community partners. WPP wants its new campuses to be good neighbours: the Cisco network can be opened securely to onsite third parties \u2013 hosting art exhibitions, food nights or accelerator programmes for start-ups.\nSmarter spaces are also more sustainable spaces. Cisco Meraki sensors will track a range of energy and environmental data. This will help reduce usage and costs, and also make for a better working environment. For instance, WPP wants to create \u2018library-like\u2019 silent areas to allow employees space to think. There will be audio monitors to track noise pollution. Heat maps will show busy routes and pinch points in the new campuses \u2013 vital data as employees return to the workplace but perhaps not in the same patterns as before.\nCisco Meraki sensors in the campus data centres are already enabling WPP to reduce energy consumption across its heating and cooling infrastructure. WPP asserts a 44 percent cut in cooling energy and a 27 percent drop in total energy consumption for its data centre in Sea Containers House, London, thanks to closer monitoring. This monitoring, and the savings, will be replicated worldwide. Globally, it is estimated that this will equate to a reduction in carbon emissions of 86 kilotons \u2013 the equivalent of planting 1.5 million trees per annum.\nThe ability to monitor globally distributed data centres was only achievable thanks to the power of the cloud-first Cisco Meraki platform.The automatic and wireless connectivity to smart cameras enabled the sensors to be deployed in minutes at each location. Once connected to the platform, data centre activity could be tracked, monitored and managed remotely.\nHigham believes IT can reduce its own energy-related emissions by 60 percent and help buildings achieve 30 percent reductions. WPP\u2019s success in hitting these targets, and the route it took to get there, will be used to help clients in their own journey.\n\u201cOur clients are undergoing their own digital transformation,\u201d says Higham. \u201cOur own experience gives us credibility in conversations around new workstyles, office design, sustainability and global collaboration.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t just have a typical customer/vendor relationship with Cisco, they are an extended part of our IT family. The relationship is very much two-way. WPP will use its transformation, and its changing requirements, to inform Cisco product development \u2013 getting early access to new products and we can offer Cisco an experimental environment on a global scale.\nWPP Head of Enterprise Technology Architecture"

You can almost zoom in and read the labels on the glasses that are 25 feet away.\nJASON WITTMER\nDirector, Infrastructure and IT Operations\nVisionworks is a leading provider of eye care services in the U.S., sitting at the intersection of healthcare and retail. The company is passionate about flawless vision and wants every person who visits its stores and affiliated doctors to have an incredible experience in an unexpectedly simple way.\nVisionworks brings healthcare expertise backed with a network of optometrists and technicians, as well as retail associates, ready to fulfill vision prescription needs, including glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses.\nVisionworks is constantly on the lookout for innovative technology solutions that will help streamline business operations, reduce costs, and\u2014most importantly\u2014enhance the customer experience.\nAs the company dealt with lockdowns and other restrictions during the pandemic, the Visionworks IT team, led by Jason Wittmer, Director of Infrastructure and IT operations, accelerated the implementation of key technology initiatives that were instrumental in enabling the business to move forward with minimal disruption.\nAs retail and clinical locations began to reopen, empowering them with networking capabilities that exceed the expectations of customers, patients, and retail associates was a top priority. With a customer base that has grown accustomed to Wi-Fi connectivity in retail spaces, and the rollout of a new cloud-based point-of-sale system, the IT team needed to ensure that all of its locations were equipped with a secure, high-performance Wi-Fi networking solution.\nAlong with enhancing Wi-Fi capabilities, the company wanted to modernize its existing networking and security infrastructure to improve performance, simplify IT operations, and continue to realize operational efficiencies.\nIn early 2020, Visionworks began deploying cloud-managed access points in all of its retail outlets. The Cisco Meraki MR access points give retail associates the flexibility to use their new tablet-based point-of-sale system to receive payment from customers wherever they are in the store. And with their guest Wi-Fi capabilities, access points make it simple for Visionworks\u2019 customers and patients to securely connect their mobile devices to the internet while they\u2019re in the store.\nVisionworks is also deploying cloud-managed Meraki switches to its retail locations as part of its network infrastructure modernization initiative, and is installing Meraki smart cameras for improved physical security and theft prevention. While many of the company\u2019s locations were already equipped with security cameras, these devices used outdated technology, provided poor resolution, and required an on-site technician for configuration and maintenance. The Meraki MV cameras provide unmatched in-store visibility and their remote management capabilities give the IT team superior control.\nThe deployment of Meraki products in retail locations has dramatically streamlined day-to-day maintenance and operations for Jason and his team. With the Meraki dashboard, the IT team now has 24/7 visibility into the status of switches, access points, and smart cameras across all of the company\u2019s sites. This has proven to be an enormous advantage by substantially reducing costs and effort and freeing up the IT team to pursue other important initiatives.\nTroubleshooting, in particular, is an area where Visionworks has seen significant operational improvements. Instead of sending a technician to a retail site to diagnose and correct a technical issue, his team can now perform a remote packet capture on Meraki switches, allowing them to quickly pinpoint and resolve issues to limit the impact on business operations.\n\nWith the addition of Meraki access points, associates and customers now enjoy a superior in-store Wi-Fi experience, and the Meraki smart cameras are providing enhanced security. Not only that, with their immersive 360-degree view, the cameras have paved the way for the company to explore a variety of additional beneficial use cases for the technology. For example, the Visionworks marketing team is using the cameras to quickly and remotely examine in-store signage and collateral and evaluate the need to refresh messaging to support new campaigns.\n\nLooking ahead, Visionworks sees the Meraki solution, with its flexibility, ease of use, and scalability, as a strong fit for its technology vision of quickly addressing new business requirements without the need to re-architect the network. With Meraki, Visionworks can continue to provide its customers and associates with a user experience that is second to none."

    "text": "[The YMCA] buildings are massive and take a lot of cameras to properly cover.\nVice President of Technology, Greater Wichita YMCA\n\nA local YMCA\u2014or more simply, the Y\u2014is a community hub that welcomes and supports all. The leading nonprofit provides opportunities for local residents to improve their health, offers after-school programs and team sports for school-age children, and gives the community a place to come together.\nOne of the top nonprofit organizations in the U.S. is the Greater Wichita YMCA, with almost 1,500 staff, ten traditional branches, and three large indoor sports facilities. The Greater Wichita YMCA is a prominent community presence, with staff members placed at nearly every school in the area to support in-school and after-school programs.\nAnd where other Ys typically have community membership levels of up to 5% of residents, for Greater Wichita, that figure is a staggering 40%. It\u2019s a measure of participation that makes them justifiably very proud.\nAcross their ten locations, the buildings are incredibly large, and it\u2019s difficult to cover everything with cameras. At the back-end of their legacy cameras, a bank of DVRs in multiple closets was gathering footage, so retrieving video was complicated and very time consuming for staff. A technician would have to go to each DVR, plug into it, retrieve the video to see what was there, then move to a DVR in another area and repeat the process over and over again.The process was a huge drain on staff resources.\nStaff could spend hours monitoring and reviewing video. When incidents were reported, staff could easily find themselves going down a rabbit hole to track related footage. The Greater Wichita YMCA needed a more effective and efficient alternative.\nPreviously, unless a serious crime was committed, we wouldn\u2019t pull video. With Meraki cameras, video is much more accessible and visually clear- we have been able to leverage it in many more instances.\nVice President of Technology, Greater Wichita YMCA\nWhen a new branch opened in the nearby city of Newton, the Y placed its first order for new Cisco Meraki MV cloud-managed smart cameras. Pond and his team were immediately impressed.\nThe cameras brought a new wave of future-proof technology with cloud management. A dashboard gave a centralized view of all the camera visuals, and the cloud-managed system meant new features were added to help streamline setup, management, and camera configuration. The higher resolution of these cameras also meant that a fewer number could cover the same area\u2014a big win for an organization on a limited budget.\nPond pushed this idea further and tried different camera suppliers with 1080p resolutions, but found that the quality wasn\u2019t better than the Y\u2019s original DVRs. While video retrieval was via a network, the process was not simple. For Pond, the obvious answer was the\nMeraki dashboard for all of their infrastructure management.\nThe Y ordered a set of Meraki cameras and hardware that their technical team could install themselves. Additionally, fewer cameras were needed to cover large areas like basketball courts.\nFor Pond, the Meraki platform has more advantages because of new capabilities to expand coverage to additional areas. Now, children at play are also monitored. Parents using the Y\u2019s facilities can drop children at the Kids\u2019 Zone for up to two hours and view them on monitors while they are working out or in a class within the building. The monitors in the adult exercise areas live stream the video feed from the cameras in the Kids\u2019 Zone\nIt\u2019s not day care, but most facilities have this offering and parents are providing a lot of very positive feedback.\nThe Meraki cameras and sensors also helped prevent a potential catastrophe at the Y\u2019s data center. Recently, an outage took down all power and air conditioning. The Y has an emergency generator, but the IT team quickly discovered thermal issues. The Meraki temperature sensors triggered an alert to Pond via the Meraki Mobile App, email, and SMS text. These alerts potentially saved the Greater Wichita YMCA hundreds of thousands of dollars in what could have been damaged equipment, loss of data, as well as overall impact to facility operations.\n\u201cWe were fortunate to have the early alerts provided by the Meraki sensor.\u201d\nMeraki technology is indispensable for the Greater Wichita Y as it touches every aspect of operations, including Wi-Fi access, switchboards, and all of the transactional business. Up to 30,000 unique wireless devices are supported at the Y with Meraki wireless each week.\nFor the small technical team, Meraki allows the Y to run lean and not worry about a thing.\nThat becomes even more important now as the Greater Wichita YMCA and the YMCA of Hutchinson & Reno County have joined together to better serve their communities.\nWith the Meraki portfolio, it will be a straightforward expansion to add sites and Meraki cameras. The benefits of selecting future-proof technology with cloud management are already scoring results."

    "text": "If a falcon is asleep, it is nothing. And when it hunts, it looks like an eagle. A toucan is a beautiful, big, tropical bird, a cheerful animal, a social animal that fits our identity so much better.\nIn 1939, Martien and Rie Van der Valk opened their eight-room first hotel. It was an upgrade of the former caf\u00e9 Gouden Leeuw opened by his father Nicolaas Van der Valk in1862 in Voorschoten, The Netherlands. Since then, the hospitality family business has been continued by their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and now by their great-great-grandchildren. In 2000, the Van der Valk Hotels and Restaurants chain became a franchise enterprise with one condition: Every franchise holder must be a direct descendant of Martien Van der Valk. Today, almost 160 years after the Van der Valk tradition began, the rather unique family enterprise has grown to 18 existing hotels, with most of the hotels in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, the Caribbean, and Spain. In addition, there are two new hotels under construction in Lelystad and Gorinchem, both in The Netherlands. The homely and cosy atmosphere once started by Martien Van der Valk remains the most valued asset in the family tradition; this is transmitted and reinforced in each and every one of the hotels. Whilst enjoying modern, elegant interior design enhanced by state-ofthe-art technology for the hospitality industry, guests can expect to see Van der Valk family members present in the hotels every day. Perhaps someone is lucky enough to have one of the Van der Valk clan members personally telling old family stories while sipping a cocktail at the Sky Bar, or even sharing a secret family recipe used in the restaurant, so the guest can try it at home.\nIn addition, there are two new hotels under construction in Lelystad and Gorinchem, both in The Netherlands.

Perhaps someone is lucky enough to have one of the Van der Valk clan members personally telling old family stories while sipping a cocktail at the Sky Bar, or even sharing a secret family recipe used in the restaurant, so the guest can try it at home.\nVan der Valk Ghent will be the hotel of the future by 2030\nGeneral Manager, Van der Valk Ghent Hotel\nMax Van der Valk is the fifth generation running the family business. Max is the General Manager of the latest addition to the family hotels chain: The Van der Valk Hotel Ghent, in Belgium. In June 2019, Max embarked himself in the construction of the hotel in Ghent from scratch. The construction continued during the Covid pandemic and lasted for two years. Today, the hotel has 263 rooms across the 23,000m2 property making it one of the largest from the existing 18 hotels in the chain. Max wants to have guests connected since they book, eliminating check-in, with a welcoming front desk that is also walk-through and payment is not an ordeal. Max wants guests to open the door of a room where the lights go on as they enter and they are immersed in a personalised, curated environment within the hotel where everything runs seamlessly according to their specific needs. \u201cAt the hotel in Ghent we\u2019d like to automate everything,\u201d says Max. Yet, automation would never reach the level of incorporating robots. Max wants to preserve the human factor, the warm friendliness and personalised care experience that made the Van der Valk brand what it is today. One of Max\u2019s priorities is to automate the staff disponibility across the hotel to better serve guests, offering the maximum comforts, attention, and personalisation during their stay. Max\u2019s ambition is to see his hotel in Ghent not only as a Van der Valk flagship hotel but also as a model for the hospitality industry. \u201cVan der Valk Ghent will be the hotel of the future,\u201d he says.\nThe ambitious construction of a majestic hotel during a pandemic was not easy. The biggest challenge was the IT infrastructure in the new building and the wireless network. In order to work, the change had to be cost The decision to change from Cisco Classic network solutions used in all the existing Van der Valk hotels \u2014 except for the shared office location in The Netherlands where they have a fully managed Meraki solution from IT partner Avit\u2014 to full-stack Meraki for the hotel in Ghent meant to dive into uncharted waters. By making the transition in the hotel in Ghent, management could evaluate the added value that the Meraki solutions can provide to the brand and potentially to the other hotels in the chain. In a way, the hotel in Ghent would serve as a pilot project. The energy consumption was a concern. The air conditioning consumes a lot of energy which is wasted in empty rooms and business areas\nThe smart camera solution immediately solved a lot of issues. We chose this solution because it has the best of both worlds: A really good wireless connectivity with extra access points that is cost efficient.\nGeneral Manager, Van der Valk Ghent Hotel\nThe incorporation of automation played a key role for the Van der Valk Hotel in Ghent. The decision to incorporate smart cameras was paramount to capture real-time data and achieve Max\u2019s goal of using automation in order to deliver an excellent service to guests whilst using staff\u2019s time efficiently. At the same time, the incorporation of smart cameras could bring real-time data to help managers know guests and staff location within the building. This would optimise daily staff allocation planning, they would be where and when they were needed the most. With the help of real-time data and predictive analytics, management could use the data to help plan staff\u2019s shifts better, more efficiently, and in advance in order to offer the best possible seamless service to guests at specific times. Long-time IT partner Avit provided the infrastructure and service which included Meraki solutions. For Avit, selling infrastructure only was not going to give business competence. It was imperative for the IT partner to add more value to the Van der Valk brand, thus improving the business model. Through the use of sensors, it is possible to resolve the problem of the energy wasted in empty rooms. The air-conditioning and lights automatically switch off when the sensors do not detect the presence of a guest.\nSelling infrastructure only is not going to give business competence. You need to give more value to the brand.\nManaging Director and Co-Owner at Avit Group\nThanks to the use of real-time data that shows the location of guests and employees at all times across the different areas in the hotel, both inside and outside, it was possible to achieve the goal of planning and automating daily work and schedules for hotel staff. The new way of working brings benefits for the employees as well. Since it is possible to determine if they are going to be needed or not, for instance, during a dinner sitting, they can now go home before their shift ends. With the help of IT partner Avit, it was possible to incorporate the use of the Meraki smart cameras system included in the wireless network environment that was installed in the hotel. Strategically located, 47 indoor smart cameras and 9 cameras located outdoors, the CCTV system increased the security of the property in the hotel and in the parking space. By the beginning of 2022, smart locks are going to be added to the IoT network and they will be also connected to the Meraki Wi-Fi. Thanks to Meraki solutions and with the help of IT partner Avit, the Van der Valk Hotel Ghent can start building more use cases making the rooms fully ready for the future. The road ahead will lead toward Max\u2019s vision of the hotel of the future for 2030, a kind of hotel that would make his great-great-grandfather Martien Van der Valk, the very founder of the Van der Valk tradition, utterly proud."

    "text": "\nThe prolonged pandemic has created difficulties for the entire restaurant franchise industry including Mad for Garlic. In response, MFG Korea, the operating company of Mad for Garlic, turned to advanced IT as a solution and created a contact-free ordering process in each of its restaurants. Since it is a new attempt, we had to consider a lot of things. Our biggest concern was how to build and efficiently manage a powerful but secure network to run such new service at 41 branches across the country. Cisco Meraki, a smart cloud-managed networking solution, helped us with its remote monitoring\nand management technology without having to deploy IT personnel at each site.\nChief Operating OfficerData On (IT Operation Subsidiary for Mad for Garlic)\nMad for Garlic launched innovative digital technology, M-TABORDER (here on as \u2018Tab Order\u2019) to turn crisis into opportunity\nMad for Garlic, a Korean restaurant brand, started in 2001 specializing in Italian food with a theme on garlic and wine. It has been loved by many Korean customers for over 20 years. However, the unprecedented\nCOVID-19 pandemic led to a crisis for Mad for Garlic as it did for the entire food service industry. In response, it worked to come up with ways to secure the safety of customers by minimizing face-to-face interaction at its restaurants. As part of this process, MFG Korea decided to turn to fundamental yet innovative solutions by making its IT division into a venture to research and develop innovative digitalization technology. The venture, Data On, soon launched a breakthrough technology that will change the entire food service industry.\nWithin a year of its launch, Data On released a new IT service platform named \u2018M-PLATFORM\u2019 which is an integrated F&B platform that supports the entire process from reservation and waiting for a table to ordering, making payment, and even customer service afterwards. Since then, Data On has been quick to validate its new platform and solutions in the market by applying the contact-free ordering solution \u2018Tab Order\u2019 to a Mad for Garlic restaurant in D Tower downtown Seoul.\nCisco Meraki provides ideal infrastructure for retail industry with real-time visualization of remote monitoring and management\nHowever, the problem remained of how to build powerful but reliable network infrastructure to support the operations of this new solution. In addition, a means of efficient management was required since the new solution needed to be applied to 41 branches nationwide. After much deliberation, Mad for Garlic decided to choose the \u2018KT Managed On\u2019 service based on Cisco Meraki.\nThe strength of Cisco Meraki is that it makes complex network management easy for anyone. It uses the cloud to allow remote monitoring and operating off-site. It also optimizes the management of network resources by intuitively visualizing networking status through an integrated dashboard. In addition, automatic updates to the latest firmware help to rapidly respond to security vulnerabilities, allowing easy operation and management without having to hire a large number of IT specialists. This is why Cisco Meraki has been selected by leading global retail businesses as a standard networking solution. In fact, Cisco Meraki has been playing a critical role in ensuring that uninterrupted advanced IT services are effectively provided at hundreds or thousands of restaurants globally without deploying additional IT personnel. This makes Cisco Meraki a proven solution and a perfect fit for the needs of Mad for Garlic.\n\u2018KT Managed On\u2019 to operate and manage network infrastructure\nEven greater news came when KT, Korea\u2019s top telecommunication service provider, launched \u2018KT Managed On\u2019, a Cisco Meraki-based managed service. KT has been providing managed services featuring variety of networking solutions to many customers, but it was convinced of the value of Meraki proven from a wide range of global customer references and experiencing it on their own. To allow more local companies to benefit from Cisco Meraki, KT provides remote deployment and centralized management services built upon Meraki\u2019s reliable performance and operational convenience at its control center. In addition, KT provides end-to-end management service for KT Managed On from sales to deployment and technical support over a number of extended products and its broad spectrum of maintenance infrastructure that Mad for Garlic became certain of their choice.\nMad for Garlic makes breakthrough for food service industry with its innovation\nMad for Garlic installed a tablet at each table in its D Tower branch restaurant using the Tab Order Solution and tested Cisco Meraki-based KT Managed On for a month. The outcomes of this pilot project went beyond expectations and proved that Mad for Garlic had made the right decision. As a result, customers can enjoy their restaurant experience in a safer environment and the quality of service improved due to automated ordering process enabling speedy and accurate services supported by seamless network connection.\nMad for Garlic expanded its Tab Order service using Cisco Meraki-based KT Managed On service to all 41 of its restaurant branches in July 2021. In addition, Data On, which is actively seeking to digitalize restaurant industry by supplying an integrated IT platform, is moving forward by providing solutions to other franchises such as \u2018Modern Shabu House\u2019, a shabushabu restaurant franchise partnering with Cisco Meraki and KT Managed ON continuously.\nIn today\u2019s food service industry, an IT platform is a necessity though it is often difficult for restaurants with limited human and financial resources and experience to adopt to such changes. Fortunately, however, Mad for Garlic, Data On, KT with Cisco Meraki are teaming up to help to this roadmap of innovation."

    "text": "Meraki has been a great partner. The team has been attentive to our needs and willing to listen, which is evident by a few feature requests we placed coming to fruition.\nDirector of Technology, East Stroudsburg Area School District\nFounded in 1891, the East Stroudsburg Area School District (ESASD) serves a large geographic area encompassing 217 square miles in parts of Monroe and Pike Counties of the Poconos in northeast Pennsylvania. The district has experienced immense and rapid growth during its more than 100 years in operation, and now facilitates nearly 7,000 students through their K-12 journey, both in-person and virtually.\nWhat does it take to cultivate a safe learning environment? This is a prevalent question now more than ever. Answers may vary, but a great first step starts with agile planning and tactical surveillance. Students and faculty should feel comfortable going to school knowing they have security teams looking out for them. Conversely, security staff should feel confident knowing they have accessible visibility into the environments they are serving.\nThe ESASD technology team, led by Director of Technology Brian Borosh, has worked hard to become more efficient and proactive in their security approach by effectively utilizing their resources to create the safest learning environment for each of their ten schools. However, due to their rural, dispersed school campuses, monitoring the safety of each was difficult and cumbersome for their school police force and administrators. They were dealing with cameras that would often break and shut down, requiring days of maintenance, not to mention travel time between school locations to manually upload footage and access faulty cameras.\nThis lack of visibility was taking a toll on school safety with a risk of inconsistent or nonexistent camera footage from cases of vandalism, physical altercations, and other general threats. The district also had concerns with worker\u2019s compensation claims that could not be confirmed or verified with security footage. It was clear that the time had come to update the physical security system with modernization in mind.\nThe MV smart cameras have helped tremendously by cutting down on time spent doing maintenance and increasing overall visibility into school environments.\nDirector of Technology, East Stroudsburg Area School District\nFor Brian and his team, a safer learning environment also meant creating a smarter one. It was clear these outdated cameras were not working correctly and costing the team money, hours, and peace of mind. They decided to partner with Meraki and take a step toward modernizing their physical security by moving into the cloud, a step that would transition each school within the district into a smarter, safer place for students and faculty alike.\nESASD began by deploying 40 Meraki MV cloud-managed smart cameras to one of their smaller elementary schools. The cameras were placed in hallways, stairwells, and cafeterias to monitor school activity and prevent and respond to any security issues. The team was excited to learn that the installation process of each camera was incredibly simple, involving just a single Cat 6 run that could go anywhere the school had a network switch in range (100 m). This was in contrast to the cumbersome installation of the dated cameras, which required installing separate power supplies and running a coax cable to one of a few DVRs in each building.\nBecause of the cloud-managed nature of Meraki smart cameras, ESASD could now access footage remotely through one dashboard. This allowed the team to monitor and send footage on the fly from all 40 cameras.\nThe easy-to-use dashboard also made training for school police, central office administrators, HR, and principals incredibly intuitive.\nHappy with the initial results of the new MV smart cameras and the ease of installation and training, ESASD went school by school to remove legacy cameras and upgrade all locations. They are now using over 1,000 MV cameras across all ten schools, six non-instructional facilities, and two stadiums. This would not have been possible without the support and financial commitment from the ESASD School Board.\nSince using the new cameras, ESASD has been able to better capture relevant footage in worker\u2019s compensation claims, which has saved the district tens of thousands of dollars by proving almost half the submitted claims were inaccurate. Beyond saving the district from fraudulent case costs, the cameras have also given confidence back to students and faculty, knowing their environment is being monitored accurately, consistently, and intelligently: a confidence that is priceless.\nBefore collaborating with Meraki, Operations Analyst Anthony Calderone would spend several hours each week trying to keep the cameras up-and-running, costing the district more money and wasted time. With the MV smart cameras having local storage, the need for space on the SAN, as well as the maintenance upkeep that comes along with it, has been alleviated. Anthony and his team now spend very little time working on cameras, usually amounting to less than five hours per month.\nPartnering with smart cloud-first Meraki cameras has helped ESASD transform the student and faculty experience by nurturing a deeper sense of well-being and security. In addition to cultivating the safest learning environment, ESASD has now positioned themselves toward creating smarter campuses and safer learning environments with an agile take on physical security."

DB Schenker needed an integrated solution that would make monitoring and troubleshooting easier.\nThis involved implementing Meraki Wi-Fi access points (MR), switches (MS), and security appliances (MX) in 90% of DB Schenker\u2019s Singapore warehouses, including the Red Lion.\nWith Cisco Meraki, everything is now centralized and can be configured and monitored from a single dashboard.\u00a0 The IT team can simply log in anytime, anywhere, on a computer or phone, via the Meraki app,\u201d said Lim Han Yong, the Global Infrastructure Services Country Head.\nThe Meraki solutions simplified warehouse communications monitoring and significantly reduced troubleshooting time.\nWe require 60% fewer resources, and we\u2019ve been able to redivert all those extra resources to other areas of operations.\nGlobal Infrastructure Services Country Head\nThe dashboard provides a single view of all statuses and easy management of equipment. Troubleshooting with Meraki now happens in a matter of minutes, compared to hours with the legacy systems.\nFor example, previously when there were problems with the wireless controller, all access points would be affected. This resulted in extended periods of downtime. The Meraki solution significantly reduces this impact, as each access point is independent of the other.\nDB Schenker rolled out Meraki solutions across its warehouses in Singapore.\nWe know that the faster we migrate, the sooner life will be made easier for our team. But most importantly, the ones who benefit the most are our customers. With a more stabilized and secure network, we can deliver on our service-level agreements (SLAs) without disruptions.\nChief Information Officer\nDB Schenker plans to incorporate more Meraki solutions in the future. For example, implementing Meraki smart cameras and sensors in warehouses like the Red Lion will help enhance the safety of their staff and the security of their warehouses. The team can utilize these technologies to keep track of social distancing as well as ensure that the right trucks are entering the warehouses.\nDB Schenker sees Meraki as its global partner for network infrastructure, and as such, plans to implement its network in all its warehouses in Asia Pacific and globally in the future."

They\u2019ve built their legacy on delivering the best possible experiences for customers by providing exemplary service and exceptional value. CAMPUS USA employees are encouraged and empowered to make a positive difference, not only in the financial lives of their customers, but also in the communities they serve.\nThe CAMPUS USA vision is all about experience, empowering employees to deliver the best experience to their customers. But what does \u201cbest\u201d mean? What does it look like?\nThe answers to those questions go beyond the face-to-face experience between employees and customers. Delivering the best customer experience means creating a smart space that can seamlessly evolve with the customer\u2019s needs, such as in-branch Wi-Fi, seamless online banking, and digital check-ins. It means ensuring a high standard of service behind the scenes, where customers aren\u2019t directly interacting with staff.\nThe sensor solution has been working great for us; we have one single dashboard for graphing, history tracking, and insight into how the data closets in our branches are doing.\nVP of Technology Services, CAMPUS USA Credit Union\nBehind the pristine front-of-house in each bank branch, CAMPUS USA was dealing with a vast array of different, inconsistent networking equipment. The lack of cohesion and visibility meant a high chance of risk. Those risks included the possibility of devices and servers crashing, overheating, and being exposed to floods, humidity, and other weather variables, all of which would result in downtime for customers and thus, a subpar experience. The team needed a way to gain reliable and responsive insight into the security of their back-of-house technology to prevent these disasters from happening and impeding their vision.\nBrian Fuller, VP of Technology Services at CAMPUS USA, was also looking ahead with a two-year plan to expand branches as well as their headquarters with improved, cohesive technology. With providing outstanding customer service as a primary goal, Brian and his 20-person technology team began taking steps to evolve the back-of-house technology.\nIt was clear that CAMPUS USA needed an environmental monitoring system that could ensure their back of house was operating just as smoothly as the front. It was paramount that this new system be simple to install, intuitive to manage, and cost effective. Brian and the team decided to partner with Meraki on a range of cloud-managed sensors. They chose to deploy the temperature and humidity sensor, the open and close sensor, and the water leak detection sensor, which they were able to install and get up and running in just 20 minutes per branch location.\nThe CAMPUS USA team was happy to have their sensors on the same monitoring system as their wireless LAN, switching, firewall, and other Cisco Meraki products. This meant no more disconnected devices \u2014 everything could be tracked, monitored, and managed seamlessly through the Meraki dashboard. This unification of technology devices behind the scenes also helps create a consistent branch-to-branch experience for customers, which reinforces the CAMPUS USA vision.\nThe team can now rest assured knowing their IT equipment is protected and that the customer experience will not be affected because of servers crashing and getting damaged. And with the intuitive single dashboard, the CAMPUS USA technology team can now manage all of their Meraki products in one place and customize the dashboard experience to include alert types based on their needs.\nJust a few months after installing the sensors, the team received an alert from the temperature sensors. Unbeknownst to the team, the air conditioning was shut off in one of their facilities on a Saturday. After receiving the temperature warning alert, the team was able to remediate the issue. Had the alert not been received, the equipment could have overheated and Campus USA could have lost $60,000 worth of hardware. More importantly, they would have not been able to provide the financial services that their customers depend on until the outage was corrected. Brian describes this ability to alleviate downtime and loss of revenue with the Meraki sensors as \u201cpriceless.\u201d\nThrough partnering with Meraki, CAMPUS USA now has peace of mind that their vision of providing an outstanding customer experience will not be at risk due to technology failure. Looking forward, Brian and his team are planning on implementing Meraki MV smart cameras for occupancy monitoring in future branch locations and also have plans to integrate the Meraki full stack at their headquarters."

    "text": "\nThe MT sensors are invaluable to us because the historic collections they protect are irreplaceable. If one piece is damaged, it could be the only piece that\u2019s in the world.\nSystems Administrator, Marmot Library Network\nSettled at the heart of the Rocky Mountains just off Interstate 70 sits the Eagle Valley Library District (Eagle Valley), just one of the 35 library members served by the Marmot Library Network technology company. Enter through the doors of any Eagle Valley Library District location and you will be greeted by an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and history, with artifacts dating back to times of gunslinging and the Wild West. Beyond just the publications in this district, Marmot Library Network maintains the online union database with a catalog of 1.2 million one-of-a-kind books, documents, maps, and works of art.\nProviding IT-related services for public, academic, and school libraries in Colorado, Marmot Library Network has ample responsibility to provide technology that will protect and secure the rare books and artifacts at each of the numerous locations\u2014and in their digital archive\u2014while also ensuring a safe, enjoyable library experience for the residents and tourists of Eagle County.\nMarmot Library Network\u2019s IT team of six employees were battling two clear challenges when it came to managing the technology at their growing family of Colorado libraries. Both revolved around security and connectivity, not only the personal information of Colorado residents and tourists and their subsequent library experience, but also the physical, irreplaceable artifacts being stored at different locations.\nWith guest experience being of utmost importance, it was vital that each library patron could log on to guest Wi-Fi to browse and research at their will. However, this had the potential to lead to cybersecurity issues that could put the user\u2019s personal information at risk. To best serve their patrons and address this ongoing risk, the Marmot team was spending countless hours making the physical trek to each location every time security updates or network maintenance was needed. In the rural Rocky Mountains, with varied and sometimes unpredictable weather, traveling to each remote library location for service updates was no simple feat.\nThe variable weather was also cause for anxiety when it came to the physical protection of the historic collections stored at different libraries. Eagle Public Library housed their most valuable pieces\u2014ranging from original mining documents to one-of-a-kind gold rush artifacts\u2014in their basement, which had a history of flooding. If any of these pieces were to be destroyed or damaged, replacement could be impossible.\nIt was clear to the Marmot Library Network team that they needed to deploy new technologies that could secure their library Wi-Fi networks remotely and protect their tangible, historic collections.\nTo address the issue of branch connectivity and online security, the Marmot team turned to Meraki. With MX security and SD-WAN appliances in place to address cybersecurity risks and MR access points and MS switches deployed for connectivity, the team quickly addressed the visitor experience challenge. Marmot IT could now manage all library locations simultaneously and remotely through one dashboard while providing various applications and services to the libraries and members.\nIn the case of the Eagle Valley location, it was crucial that the team get technology that could provide protection for these priceless artifacts up and running as soon as possible. With a history of sporadic flooding in the area, water damage could happen at any time. Neither Marmot nor the library district itself could risk more time going by without proper visibility and security. To prevent catastrophic damage, the team deployed MT water leak detection sensors to monitor for future flooding and ultimately protect the irreplaceable items, as well as the library\u2019s network infrastructure. The cloud-managed water leak detection sensor is programmed to send immediate SMS, email, or push notification alerts if water leakage in the space is detected, giving both the library and the Marmot team ample peace of mind.\nCisco Meraki products used:\nThe addition of the end-to-end Meraki solution\u2014including the MT sensors, which only took about an hour to install\u2014has given the Marmot Library Network team the comfort of having visibility into each library location without having to physically travel to and from each. This visibility allows for full and seamless management of branch networks within one intuitive dashboard, not only improving the experience for library patrons but for the Marmot team as well. Their small IT team can now operate more efficiently and productively without needing to add more staffing, which could have increased the budget by up to $1 million in payroll alone. The new sense of visibility is also greatly appreciated by the Eagle Valley Library team, who can now rest easy knowing these irreplaceable pieces of history are protected and looked after by the careful eye of the MT sensor.\nWhile the library has not experienced a flood since the sensor deployment, the Marmot team ran a test that, in their words, went \u201cbeautifully.\u201d Jason Stow, Systems Administrator at Marmot Library Network, specifically called out the SMS alert feature as \u201cinvaluable, especially when a flood is happening, to get the message out to as many people as possible in case somebody is not available.\u201d Looking to the future, the Marmot Library Network team is eager to expand their Meraki deployment in other library locations and their central hub as well, allowing for increased security and visibility, and resulting in less headache for this lean team of six."

    "text": "\nOther vendors have tried to deliver on the single pane of glass experience. None of them do it quite as well as Meraki.\nSenior System Engineer\nResting along the St. Lawrence river in the northernmost part of upstate New York is the town of Akwesasne, part of the St. Regis Mohawk reservation. It\u2019s here that Tarbell Management Group has their headquarters. This family-owned and operated management business was built on values of honesty and trust, with a legacy of hard work tracing back to the 1950s and a two-pump gas station. Tarbell is now an essential part of the local community, providing much-needed services such as convenience shops, restaurants, hotels, gas stations, and more.\nMike Shonyo and two other members of the technical services department are responsible for keeping Tarbell\u2019s ten business locations connected to the network so operations run smoothly. With an array of retail business types, network downtime could have significant operational impact and lead to poor customer experiences. The local community relies heavily on Tarbell\u2019s convenience stores to feed their families and gas stations to fuel their cars. Thus, an integral part of Tarbell\u2019s mission and role within the community is to keep these locations up and running.\nFor Mike and his team, one of the main threats to the network is environmental issues. As Tarbell grew from just one gas station to multiple businesses across the region, network equipment was often stored in rooms that were not built for that purpose. This meant that network hardware was vulnerable to temperature and moisture changes brought on by the northern climate and inadequate climate control in the makeshift network closets.\nThe team had to battle the elements on multiple occasions. At one location, the cold winter months would cause a rooftop AC unit to freeze. At another, they experienced a flood due to buildup of condensation inside their HVAC system.\nTo compensate for these challenges, Mike and his team would have to regularly check network closets for temperature and moisture issues, resulting in many lost working hours. Additionally, renovating just one of the closets to bring it up to standard would have been cost-prohibitive, with a price tag of $50,000.\nMike believed he could not only improve efficiency but also increase convenience if he was able to monitor the temperature of all his Cisco Meraki hardware remotely. He submitted the idea as a \u201cwish\u201d on the Meraki dashboard and received a follow-up from the Meraki team asking if he would like to try out some of the new MT temperature and humidity sensors. Mike\u2019s response: \u201cYes please!\u201d\nMike has now installed a number of sensors in Tarbell\u2019s core data center where all of the network data travels through. This includes MT sensors to monitor for temperature, moisture, water leaks, and door access. He has also installed a Meraki MV smart camera to monitor the room and serve as a data gateway for the MT sensors.\nMike was able to set up all of this equipment in under 30 minutes, and as an added bonus, he can monitor and manage it remotely\u2014and in the same place as his other network hardware\u2014via the Meraki dashboard.\nThe MT sensors proved their value for Mike in short order. One Friday before 3 pm he got an alert from one of the MT sensors that the temperature in a network closet had reached 80 degrees fahrenheit. He was able to immediately report the alert to the maintenance team only a few minutes before they were preparing to close up shop for the weekend. The HVAC technician was able to respond to the scene and fix the issue\u2014a malfunctioning AC economizer\u2014within 15 minutes of being notified.\nWith this quick fix, the team was able to prevent a network outage, avoiding significant lost revenue as well as the loss of $130,000 worth of network hardware. On top of these potential monetary losses, the outage would have resulted in hours, if not days, of downtime, preventing retail locations from serving their customers. This downtime could have ultimately affected the brand\u2019s reputation for outstanding customer service, a reputation Tarbell prides themselves on.\nAdditionally, Mike discovered that the MT temperature probe sensor could be of great use in the fridges and freezers across Tarbell\u2019s retail locations. Mike estimates that staff were spending up to 1,000 hours per year checking the temperatures of fridges and freezers. Even with all the manual inspections, they could not prevent the loss of nearly $15,000 worth of perishables due to an overnight breakdown. By installing the MT temperature probe sensors, Mike\u2019s staff had more time to serve customers while still ensuring perishable food stays fresh.\nMike and his team have found that the Meraki dashboard is a lifesaver in terms of managing the network. They love that everything can be managed from one single location, sparing their small team from having to travel for minor troubleshooting at remote locations. And by setting up dashboard and SMS alerts, the team is immediately in-the-know when an issue arises, keeping them agile and efficient."

    "text": "Nestled just 30 miles outside the bustling, live music hub of Austin, Texas, sits the quaint suburb of Pflugerville. This city within Travis County serves as the namesake for the Pflugerville Independent School District, which encompasses approximately 95 square miles and covers 6 municipalities, including the state\u2019s capital.\nStarting as young as kindergarten, students use iPads or tablets on a daily basis for their learning, but this does not make them experts in IT. Take a look behind the curtain at a school district\u2019s hardworking IT team. These individuals are tasked with making sure each device going home with a student or being used in a classroom is up-to-date, secure, user friendly, and ready for learning.For the Pflugerville Independent School District (PFISD), the individual behind the curtain is Sean Singleton. Sean is the only mobile device management (MDM) specialist for the district, which has 25,000 students attending 30 schools. This means countless hours are spent customizing and provisioning the district\u2019s 6,500+ devices.As the district grew and the need for more devices continued to increase, Sean was left managing numerous ad-hoc requests and requirement updates. It was vital for him and his small team to combat the rapidly growing workload while keeping in mind the end user\u2019s capabilities and experience. He needed a system that was simple to understand to cut down on training time, but also effective and customizable to suit the growing IT needs of the district.\nWhile the team had already been using Meraki Systems Manager (SM) for all the district\u2019s iOs\ndevices, the need for increased automation was clear. In addition, the young age of most device\nusers was revealing challenges in the use of the self-service capabilities available. As more students were joining the district and with some moving to hybrid schooling, it was vital for Sean to get things automated to avoid error and grievances while maintaining security\nLuckily, the Meraki platform provided the team at PFISD with a new level of flexibility. Sean was able to get creative. He became a master of Systems Manager and the Meraki dashboard by deploying\nefficient enrollment and configuration using the SM API to automatically add and update tags. This automation helps avoid errors and saves time by replicating settings and configurations from selected devices to new devices through tagging. With bulk tagging and tag removal, the team can\navoid repetitive, manual clicking. Ahhh, the sign of relief for time saved.\nDon\u2019t let the simplicity of the dashboard stop you from creating your own unique solutions with the APIs.\nPflugerville Independent School District\n\n\nSean was also able to further curate the capabilities, still providing self-service, but with a twist. Self-service tags made setup easier for the end user and the team could automatically install assigned apps by sending a custom link to the device, which is simple enough for young students to click on without lengthy instructions. One click and done. Granting access could also be automated with the activation lock bypass API. Local campus technicians can send a message to a custom Slack bot, which sends an API call to unlock devices without any action from the admin. This allows teachers to bypass the activation lock after verifying identity via SSO and quickly troubleshoot in familiar situations. Again, saving time for Sean\u2019s team while improving the end user experience and maintaining\u2014and actually improving\u2014security.\nWhen hybrid learning grew across the district, Sean was able to apply restricted profiles to block students from adding personal app store IDs to school devices from home. The integration with Cisco Umbrella ensures superior security and ease of deployment. All these features allowed the team to painlessly scale from 30 apps to 200, just like that.\nPFISD did not have to add resources to their team, even as they more than doubled their devices. They were able to seamlessly pivot to the increase in at-home learning without compromising security or adding wasted time to their workload. By combining workflow simplicity and extensive\nuse of APIs, Sean can save at least 80% of the time required to manage the growing number of devices. By making the most out of the ever-flexible Meraki platform, Sean has turned an overwhelming job into a creative and enjoyable experience.\nSystems Manager is so simple that it\u2019s hard to mess up.\nPflugerville Independent School District"

This may mean a few days working from home and a few days in the office collaborating with colleagues or customers. It may also mean commuting daily or working remotely.\nHowever each enterprise\u2019s staff breaks down its workdays, numerous businesses will reconsider how they use their space, says JanJaap Boogaard, Head of Workplace Advisory EMEA, Director Corporate Solutions, at Colliers\u2019 London-based offices.\n\u201cMuch will depend on user preference \u2014 what employees want from the office,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, it is difficult to predict the future. If we can be certain of anything, it is that office space will need to be more flexible.\u201d\nTo help clients, Colliers first turned inward and considered its own office usage.\n\u201cCompanies understand the importance of the office, but they recognize the role of the office has changed,\u201d says Boogaard. \u201cThey have big decisions to make around investing in office space. And they\u2019re looking for guidance.\u201d\nTo get the answer, Colliers needed data and analytics.\nData allow us to bridge the gap between perception and reality. Data will help us visualize real usage.\nHead of Workplace Advisory EMEA, Director Corporate Solutions, Colliers\nColliers wanted to more accurately map office occupancy by viewing levels in real time, identifying busy times, and determining high-traffic areas. It then used this data to learn about space usage, resource planning, and safety controls, and move these newly dynamic spaces into the digital age.\n\u201cThe more data you can harvest, the better,\u201d Boogaard says, \u201cespecially if it\u2019s live and organic.\u201d\nColliers \u2014 which has 18,000 employees across its multinational organization \u2014 built its smart office ambitions on top of the cloud-first strategy of Cisco Meraki. It streamlined and standardized on Meraki for its IT infrastructure, allowing Colliers to put all its EMEA sites on one platform and remotely manage wireless infrastructure across the region from a single dashboard.\nColliers worked with Meraki partner Basking.io, a member of the firm\u2019s Techstars Proptech Accelerator program (which supports interesting tech start-ups). Basking.io uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to track devices that connect to a Wi-Fi network. Basking.io\u2019s technology can detect the different behavior patterns of a laptop, desktop, or mobile phone and apply statistical methods to estimate whether nearby devices indicate one person instead of two.\n\u201cThe technology is so easy to use and integrates seamlessly with Cisco Meraki. You can power up Basking.io, and within a couple of hours you\u2019ll start seeing site-occupancy metrics,\u201d says Eldar Gizzatov, CEO and Co-Founder of Basking.io.\nBefore offering Basking.io as a service to clients, Colliers used it across its own offices. It took just three weeks to deploy Basking.io in 28 offices across EMEA, and only two days to begin collecting actionable data.\n\u201cFirst, we had to determine the location of our access points in relation to the floor plans at our various offices to get a better sense of how people were using our spaces,\u201d Boogaard says. \u201cOnce connected, Basking.io took a couple of weeks to automatically fine-tune the machine-learning algorithms at each location.\u201d\nColliers\u2019 deployment of Meraki platform and networking technologies, coupled with Basking.io\u2019s workplace occupancy analytics platform, ensured a safe return to the office by providing clear occupancy rate controls. This combination also revealed hotspots and quiet spaces, helping to redefine physical office space and establishing a platform for smart facilities management.\nWelcome back to today\u2019s hybrid corporate workspace."

Its solar panel products are installed in over 100 countries, thanks to a wide network of over 1,200 local sales and installation partners.\nWith its corporate purpose of Powering Positive ChangeTM , Maxeon strives hard to fight climate change by pushing the boundaries of sustainable energy.\nMaxeon produces solar cell and panel technologies in factories located in France, Mexico, Malaysia, and the Philippines, where internet connectivity is not optimized for businesses. Headquartered in Singapore, the company has regional offices throughout the globe where they use local internet providers.\nWhen Maxeon spun off from SunPower Corporation, they needed to redesign their network. With 26 IT teams spread across the globe, multiple satellite offices, and three manufacturing plants, Maxeon assessed that operating on different network solutions would be challenging to manage remotely, especially in countries with unreliable connectivity.\nIn addition, as their business continued to grow with new satellite offices and manufacturing plants,\nso did the IT challenges.\nTo address these challenges, Maxeon looked for a solution that delivered easy-to-use cloud management of their satellite office networks.The Meraki access points allowed them to deploy at remote site locations with minimal IT staff on ground. Once deployed, the new access points could be managed remotely via the cloud.\nIn addition, the Maxeon team needed better accessibility to their security cameras. Their prior solution took an average of three to seven working  days to route, download, and send the footage back  to its requester. The Meraki MV smart cameras cut the process down to a few minutes, making  Maxeon\u2019s access to security events as easy as a few clicks.\n\u201cMaxeon placed the initial order with Meraki. Within seven days, the first batch of Meraki access points arrived, and within another four days, Maxeon\u2019s global network was fully deployed and ready.\u201d\n\u2013 Robert Tan\nI always win by executing faster, and Meraki allows me to execute my IT projects faster, better, and with smarter analytics.\nSenior Director Infrastructure & Cloud at Maxeon Solar Technologies\nWith the Meraki MR access points installed globally across Maxeon offices and manufacturing plants, including the Philippines, it became possible to have one manager supervising the entire network, which was previously impossible.\nTan recalls that he was relieved when the Meraki global network came online so quickly. Each site\nonly needed to plug-and-play and the new solutions were up and running.\nWith remote access features built into the device, Mr. Tan, who was in Singapore, took over running Maxeon networks all over the world.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that a small box could do so many things,\u201d Mr. Tan added.\nMaxeon\u2019s favorite feature is the Meraki dashboard, which can be accessed from anywhere on any device,allowing Maxeon to monitor multiple workplaces around the world. Not only does it provide rich information and analytics,it also helps keep tabs on what\u2019s happening on the ground and looks at the performance matrix and security events.\nIn addition to accessibility, Cisco Meraki delivered economic benefits since, apart from one or two devices installed in the different sites, only one device was necessary to access, control, and configure the products remotely.\nFurthermore, it was easy to train and enable someone to use and configure the Meraki products. Fewer devices, fewer people, fewer problems.\nCurrently, Maxeon is planning to install them in all offices and manufacturing plants. In addition, the leading solar maker plans to replace 180+ access points with Meraki. They are also considering deploying Meraki MT sensors to better protect critical IT infrastructure with real-time visibility into environmental conditions.\nWith the various solutions available in the market, I chose Cisco Meraki for these four reasons: switching, firewalls, Wi-Fi, and the cameras.

    "text": "Founded in 1946, Bay State is a private four-year college located in Boston\u2019s historic Back Bay neighborhood, with a second campus in Taunton, MA. The college provides its more than 900 students with a high-quality education that prepares them for professional careers in a variety of fields, including nursing, business, information technology, entertainment management, and criminal justice. A favorable student-teacher ratio and small class sizes are key differentiators that make Bay State an attractive choice for students.\nLike many colleges, in March, 2020, Bay State was forced to shut down its two campuses for the remainder of the term to ensure the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff. Many of the college\u2019s programs already had a strong online learning component, so most students could proceed with their studies with minimal disruption. For other programs that required significant hands-on instruction, such as nursing, it was clear online learning would not be sufficient. Students in these programs would need to be on campus to be able to complete their degree requirements.\nAs a result, getting students safely back to in-person learning for the fall 2020 term was the top priority for Bay State\u2019s newly formed COVID-19 Response Committee. The committee recognized that positive cases on campus were inevitable, but it also believed that wireless technology could be creatively deployed to build an effective automated contact-tracing solution. The solution could allow students to safely attend classes on campus, while also making it possible for the college to meet stringent public health regulations for social distancing and contact tracing.\nDuring the planning phase, the IT team identified a number of critical requirements. In addition to being cost-efficient and easy to deploy, the contact-tracing solution would need to deliver uncompromised security by protecting the privacy of the members of the Bay State community. The solution would also need to give the college the ability to respond quickly and accurately to any reported COVID-19 cases.\nThe Bay State team began designing an innovative wireless contact-tracing application that would leverage large-area triangulation to achieve maximum location detail for people on campus. Bay State chose Cisco Meraki to provide the foundation for the solution, installing Meraki MR access points (APs) across its two campuses.\nFaculty, staff, and students were each issued a lanyard and a badge holder containing a Bluetooth\u00ae Low-Energy (BLE) beacon, which they were required to wear visibly at all times while on campus. Each Meraki AP contains a Bluetooth antenna that listens for intermittent pings emitted by the campus ID badge holders. As people move around campus each day, multiple Meraki APs collect and triangulate the beacon data to track and record their relative location over time. The APs collect and warehouse more than 300,000 data points per day. This information is then stored until it is needed, at which point a sophisticated reporting solution generates a visual confirmation of each individual\u2019s locations along with a report of any high-risk interactions.\nBeing pressed for time, it was easy to switch out a whole wireless system and just drop the Meraki system into our current network.\nCIO, Bay State College\nThrough the Meraki cloud-based platform, Bay State has been able to successfully automate the challenging task of contact tracing. With the new solution, the college\u2019s administrators have been able to do more with less by eliminating countless hours of manual effort that would have otherwise been required to identify who had been in contact with whom on campus. Most importantly, the solution has sustained and enhanced the student experience, enabling Bay State to get students back on campus to complete their degree requirements safely.\nIn addition to facilitating rapid contact tracing, the data collected by the Meraki APs provides a real-time count of individuals on both of the college\u2019s campuses at any time, ensuring adherence to state and local occupancy level restrictions. As well, if any students arrive on campus without having completed a daily symptom check survey, the system notifies the dean of students in real time.\nWhile many weeks\u2019 worth of time and planning went into the design of the solution, installing and configuring the Meraki APs campus-wide proved to be quick and easy to scale, a fact which significantly accelerated the rollout of the solution.\nWhen the system administrator is not here, somebody else can jump in and solve the problem. For a CIO responsible for a college network, that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\nCIO, Bay State College"

With more than 10,000 employees, VCU also has a significant impact on Central Virginia\u2019s economy.\nFor a vibrant university community of this size, in which students and staff are working, learning, and conducting research in more than 150 buildings spread across two metropolitan campuses, reliable highquality wireless connectivity is essential. While VCU\u2019s existing campus wireless system was reliable and had served the university well over many years, it was not flexible enough to meet the rapidly evolving requirements of students and staff. With more than 4,000 access points, the network was extensive and complex and relied on numerous routers, wireless controllers, and other on-site equipment that was becoming increasingly challenging to manage.\nAn analysis conducted by VCU\u2019s network services team revealed that more than 60% of trouble tickets were related to back-end issues, such as provisioning, configuring, maintaining systems, and keeping software versions on the many systems up-to-date. With the network services team\u2019s two full-time engineers spending so much time dealing with these issues, they were not able to adequately address the needs of its user community, in particular the approximately 9,000 students that were living in VCU\u2019s student dormitories.\nTo meet the wireless connectivity needs across its entire campus, VCU selected the Cisco  Meraki cloud-based wireless solution.\nThe Meraki solution provides the VCU user community with unparalleled high-efficiency wireless connectivity, including better coverage, faster connections, and a seamless user experience.

That means being able to connect seamlessly to the network from within their dorms so they can meet their academic requirements, but also to enjoy a high-quality online experience when using gaming systems, smart speakers, and other connected devices during their leisure time.\nBy working with SplashAccess, a Meraki technology partner whose application is integrated into the Meraki cloud-based platform, VCU students can easily and securely enroll and manage all of their devices on the VCU network even before they step on campus, drastically minimizing help desk tickets and intervention from IT. Once connected, students enjoy a superior online experience with improved coverage and faster connections.\nThanks to the simplicity of the Meraki solution and the analytics provided by Meraki Health, the effort required to manage the network has decreased dramatically. No longer spending 60% of their time maintaining and upgrading on-site wireless controllers and other equipment, network services engineers now have the ability to configure and manage all of the university\u2019s 4,000 access points via the cloud, eliminating cost and complexity. In addition, the Meraki browser-based dashboard, part of the Meraki platform, makes it possible to shift some management responsibilities to other members of the operations team, which has resulted in faster overall response times to user inquiries.\nMost importantly, the network services team has been freed up to focus its attention on supporting a variety of new use cases, as faculty and students continue to explore the ways in which wireless technology can be used to meet their research and learning goals.\nFor example, VCU was able to leverage data from Meraki access points during the global pandemic to understand movement and density patterns of students in dorms and elsewhere on campus to ensure they were adhering to social distancing guidelines. With the assistance of these advanced analytics to safeguard the health of its students, VCU has had fewer outbreaks compared to its sister universities.\nMaking the switch to the Cisco Meraki cloud-based wireless solution was a major project for VCU that involved replacing all access points across VCU\u2019s 150+ buildings. Despite the scope of the project, combining the ease of configuration and implementation with Meraki, and with close collaboration between Meraki and their preferred partner, VCU was able to complete the implementation in six months\u2014twice as fast as planned.\nThe Meraki solution has also proven to be cost-effective. Along with the near-term savings it has realized by reducing the day-to-day management of its existing systems, VCU projects significant cost savings over the next ten years, a fact which played a major role in its selection of Meraki. The physical footprint of the Meraki solution is much smaller than that of the system it\u2019s replacing, with fewer devices to operate and pay maintenance on, and fewer devices to cause problems. What\u2019s more, key performance indicators point to an improved user experience. Since deploying the Meraki solution campus wide, VCU has seen trouble tickets decline and fielded far fewer complaints from students and staff.\nLooking ahead, VCU is excited about the Meraki solution\u2019s potential to support innovation and growth. As an example, VCU recently deployed MV smart cameras across their campuses. As new requirements and innovative use cases emerge, the VCU team is confident the Meraki cloud-based solution\u2014comprising connectivity products, IoT devices, and a platform with an ecosystem of partners\u2014will enable them to provide the best possible service to their diverse user community."

    "text": "If you drive from Boulder southbound along Colorado State Highway 93, you\u2019ll enjoy breathtaking vistas of rolling foothills, mountain peaks, and alpine streams. At the end of the road you\u2019ll find Golden, a former gold rush town that now serves as the seat of Jefferson County, home to JeffCo Public Schools, the second-largest school district in Colorado and one of the 50 largest in the United States\u2014with 155 schools spread out over 750sq miles, serving about 80,000 students.\nEnsuring a quality education for that many students requires the hard work and commitment of about 14,000 teachers and staff, who are all working towards a learning-centered vision that promotes more hands-on and skills-focused experiences for students. Underpinning that vision are core values, including a commitment to \u201cexemplary performance\u201d for both staff and students. For John Fuller, Wireless Network Engineer at JeffCo Public Schools, that means ensuring the exemplary performance of the district\u2019s vast IT infrastructure\u2014made up of approximately 7,000 wireless access points and other network hardware, as well as laptops and other devices issued to staff and students.\nDespite the existing network, when John received the news that the entire school district had to pivot to remote working, he knew that VPN access to the district\u2019s two data centers was going to be a key challenge. While students didn\u2019t need a VPN connection to access course files, staff and teachers needed it to access work files and applications. The current network infrastructure could only provide access to 200 users at a time, and suddenly it needed to be able to support thousands. Additionally, help desk staff would need to be on hand to support employees with the transition, and that would require specialized hardware to ensure security over the phone.\nAt the time John was alerted to the dramatic shift, there was a Meraki MX sitting on his desk. He had intended to use it to gather network data for reporting purposes, but wondered if it could be used to scale VPN access for staff. John picked up the phone and called Clint Russell, Product Specialist at Cisco Meraki, to see if it could. Fortunately, Clint was able to confirm that the MX could help, and was also able to answer John\u2019s questions about how to set it up. Working together with a data center architect, John and Clint were able to get the MX up and running that same day. Within hours, VPN access had expanded from 200 connections to 5,000.\n\nThings were hectic the day we found out our entire staff had to start working remotely. I called Clint, our product specialist, and with his help we set up the MX within hours and increased our VPN capacity from 200 to 5,000 overnight.\n\nWireless Network Engineer\nAt the same time, John had to think about how the employees setting up their remote work stations would get the support they needed. Fortunately, some help desk employees were already based remotely and had been set up with Meraki Z3 devices and desktop VoIP phones to ensure secure conversations. This meant staff could get the support they needed from day one of working from home. John was then able to order more Z3s to transition the rest of the help desk staff to remote work.\nIn addition to the MX and Z3, the existing Meraki network also made a big difference for John and his team. Even after setting up the MX, John\u2019s team had to be on site daily as \u201cessential staff\u201d to make critical upgrades and changes to the network in order to support the district\u2019s new working and teaching model. Because the network was completely cloud-managed via the Meraki dashboard, John\u2019s team could hunker down at HQ to make the necessary upgrades and changes without putting the team at increased risk.\n\nMy engineers and I will sometimes come up with a crazy idea. All we have to do is pick up the phone and call enterprise support and someone will walk us through it. Meraki always shows up. I can rely on them, and that\u2019s huge.\n\nWireless Network Engineer\nHaving a robust network, along with other technology investments such as district-issued laptops for some students and staff, went a long way to ensuring the success of the new hybrid learning model that the district implemented to keep students and teachers safe. High school teachers, for example, were able to conduct in-person and remote instruction simultaneously over a live stream supported by the Meraki network.\nJeffCo Public Schools had set out to realize an ambitious learning-centered vision for its students built on values of integrity, valuing people, teamwork, and exemplary performance. Thanks in large part to their investment in technology, the district was able to rapidly pivot to a new, hybrid model of teaching and learning. With the MX to support rapid scaling of VPN access, the Z3 to support remote help desk workers, and a robust and reliable Meraki network, John and his team were able to keep the district on track toward realizing their vision. Additionally, John was able to benefit from the outstanding support of the Meraki team, who were on-hand throughout the transition to ensure success. Through quick-thinking and teamwork, John and the entire JeffCo Public Schools team can continue to deliver exemplary education for generations to come."

    "text": "Headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia, with four additional offices in the state, as well as in Maryland, RRMM Architects is a leading, dynamic design firm offering architectural, design build, interior design, and planning services. The firm\u2019s project experience encompasses schools, public safety facilities, secure federal facilities, higher education facilities, retail stores, and housing, among others. Licensed in the 49 contiguous states, RRMM has successfully completed projects nationwide and worldwide while developing a reputation for comprehensive and imaginative designs and exceptional customer service.\nOver the last several years, demand for RRMM\u2019s services has expanded, and the company has opened additional offices in new cities to ensure that it can provide high-quality architecture and design services to its growing client base. With more employees and locations than ever before, including remote workers needing to access office resources, RRMM\u2019s networking requirements were becoming increasingly complex. Another issue with rising complexity was RRMM\u2019s existing networking equipment. The company\u2019s lean IT team was spending many hours troubleshooting persistent network reliability problems without many insights to guide their efforts. RRMM was ready to make a change to a cloud-managed security and SD-WAN solution that would cost-effectively scale to support its growth plans, while providing the level of security, stability, and reliability it needed.\nTo meet its evolving business and technology requirements, Aaron Sturniolo, IT Director at RRMM, selected Cisco Meraki cloud-managed solutions. Aaron began with a free trial of a Meraki MR access point, which he tested both at home and in the RRMM Chesapeake headquarters. Impressed by how the MR access points were more reliable and could give employees faster Wi-Fi connections and better coverage, Aaron quickly moved ahead with deployment across all RRMM offices. As the company opened additional offices, secure, reliable VPN connectivity between sites was critical, so it made the decision to deploy the Meraki MX series security and SD-WAN enterprise appliances in all of its locations, along with the Meraki MS switches.\nIn addition to secure site-to-site connectivity with Meraki Auto VPN, Aaron and his team are able to take advantage of the many advanced features of the MX security appliances to manage bandwidth and protect against cyber threats. These include application-aware traffic control, content filtering, and intrusion protection.\nNon-business-related traffic, for example, can be easily filtered, and personal devices not authorized for use on the network or that may pose a security threat can be blocked. As well, with more of the company\u2019s meetings now taking place virtually, RRMM\u2019s IT team can ensure that employees and clients enjoy the best possible quality of experience by creating a rule to give priority to video conferencing traffic.\nRRMM is also benefiting from the operational speed and agility made possible by the Meraki solution to adapt to changing work environments. When the majority of its employees needed to transition to remote work, for example, Aaron\u2019s IT team had to act quickly to implement a solution that would make the transition smooth without hampering productivity. By deploying the Meraki MX security and Z3 teleworker solutions, RRMM was able to securely extend the capabilities of the Meraki cloud-managed network to all of its employees wherever they were located. Self-configuring and managed over the web, Aaron\u2019s IT team was able to rapidly connect remote locations without having to rely on assistance from end-users.\nSince deploying the Meraki cloud-managed solution, RRMM has realized numerous benefits that have helped strengthen its business and become more efficient and cost-effective during a period of significant growth.\nThe company has been able to deploy Meraki Security Appliances at each of its office locations in minutes using zero-touch cloud provisioning. Security settings are simple to synchronize across all sites using templates, and Auto VPN technology enables the IT team to securely connect new offices in three clicks using the Meraki dashboard.\nFor Aaron, it\u2019s this simplicity that stands out about the Meraki solution, especially in comparison to the company\u2019s previous networking solution, which was labor-intensive to set up and required additional training for staff to use specialized software.\n\nWhen you plug in a Meraki product, you don\u2019t have to do much to get it up and running. It just works.\n\nDirector of IT, RRMM Architects\nThis simplicity was especially helpful when Aaron\u2019s IT team was supporting dozens of remote work environments. Even RRMM\u2019s clients were impressed at the speed with which the company was able to make the transition and the lack of disruption it caused to ongoing client projects. For the employees themselves, their digital experience was exactly the same as if they were in the office, giving them everything they needed to continue to excel at their jobs and produce top-notch work for clients. Now, after benefitting from this optimized remote work solution, the RRMM team takes their MX security appliances on the road, utilizing the solution over services provided by hotels and other businesses.\nThe solution has also proven to be cost-effective for the company. For example, equipping employees with MX and Z3 solutions meant that they could continue using their desktop computers at home, avoiding the cost of upgrading to expensive laptop computers. In addition, as a result of the reduction of provisioning time and the migration to easy cloud-based management, Aaron and his team have been freed up to devote more time to pursuing other high-priority IT initiatives. Aaron believes the Meraki deployment has personally saved him so much time that it would have required three additional team members to accomplish the same results.\nThe ease of use and cost and time savings that Aaron experienced have proven to be invaluable benefits for his team and RRMM\u2019s overall business. Looking to the future, RRMM is confident that their Meraki solutions will provide the support they need to tackle the next challenge."

By 2030, they want all their projects to be climate-neutral through design excellence.\nFounded in 1951 in Gothenburg, the firm has since expanded to 11 offices and studios across Sweden, Norway, and the UK, doubling the number of employees to 700 in just the past 15 years.\nPa\u030al Annerstro\u0308m, Head of Operations, has been part of leading the firm\u2019s digital transformation to support its growth and ambitious goals.\nBig aspirations require the right foundation and framework in order to succeed. Pa\u030al realized that the initial network infrastructure fell short. Throughout the years, adding and replacing hybrid solutions from different vendors resulted in a lack of overview. In addition, this made it almost impossible to forecast costs, a very crucial part when planning for the future.\nOther challenges to tackle were reducing costs and avoiding connectivity issues. Relying only on MPLS lines for WAN connectivity meant that if the network was down in the Gothenburg head office, the other offices would be in trouble too. Luckily, their trusted IT partners came to the rescue and recommended Cisco Meraki.\nPa\u030al and his team needed to prepare their network for the future by improving connectivity, reducing costs, and making expenses more predictable at the same time. After seeing how Meraki could help\nthem achieve this, they were fully convinced that it was the right business solution.\nThree elements stand out in the new deployment:\nWhile planning for the transformation of their IT infrastructure, Pa\u030al decided to lean on managed services as much as possible. This means that IT partners deploy and manage the network, usually at a fixed cost per month. With a team of eight employees, who all need to have a good grasp of the organization, the help was more than welcome.\nBetter prediction of costs was high on the priority list for White Architects. Managed services play a big role, but the switch from MPLS only to SD-WAN for connectivity between offices helped decrease those costs the most. By reducing dependency on MPLS lines, the team now takes advantage of low cost WAN-links by using Meraki MX security and SD-WAN appliances on every location. As a result, Pa\u030al and the team could cut WAN costs in half.\nI was fully convinced after I saw what Cisco Meraki could help us achieve.\n\nHead of Operations, White Architects\nThe wireless solutions in the offices needed an upgrade too, and Pa\u030al did not hesitate to prioritize longevity of the new network. He needed to make sure that it could support future evolutions in technology, so Wi-Fi 6 access points perfectly fit the bill. High-quality switching is equally important for an architecture firm, due to the fact that they work with large model files and need to rely on wired connections as often as wireless. The team recently started working on their models in the cloud, another step closer to better collaboration and achieving their goals.\nEven if changing our network infrastructure was an investment, we could promise the business to cut WAN costs in half.\n\nHead of Operations, White Architects\nStarting their journey with Meraki has significantly optimized the IT infrastructure at White Architects. Even more important, the firm is on track to reach their goals around climate-neutral designs.\nAlmost every corner of the business has noticed a positive change after implementing the new network: the finance department can better predict operational costs, connectivity in and between offices has dramatically improved, and the network is much easier to manage (even more so with help from their IT partner). As a result, the IT teams don\u2019t have to travel as often anymore, and as Pa\u030al would describe it, \u201cIn offices where we don\u2019t have an IT person full time, our employees are obviously most productive when they are drawing houses. Since we deployed Meraki everywhere, they can just set it and forget it.\u201d\nFind out more at whitearkitekter.com"

    "text": "Ecole Lemania prides itself on offering a holistic educational experience that prepares students of every age to use their acquired knowledge to shape the future. In order to accomplish this goal, instructors and students rely on access to technology and the resources being used to define current trends in society. Providing a reliable network to\nsupport the school\u2019s daily needs is of paramount importance to Leonard Jan, IT Manager at Ecole Lemania.\nSituated at the edge of Lake Geneva in Lausanne, Switzerland, the school supports over 400 students between the ages of 12-18 in its multi-lingual high school program, and another 900 yearly in adult programs like business, accounting, and commerce. Based on complaints from many of these users, Jan had known the previous network was not ideal; the system would often crash every few days or even every few hours. \u201cBefore Meraki it was a total nightmare,\u201d explained Jan. \u201cWe even lost two boarding students because of the unreliable network!\u201d\nBefore, commercial-grade access points placed on every other floor provided the school with wireless. However, extremely challenging wireless environments existed in two of the main buildings: very thick walls in a 1908 building and armed concrete in a 1970s building. When signals could be seen by end user devices, data was unlikely to pass, and with over 400 concurrent clients, poor user experience was prevalent. Jan began esearching\nother possible solutions.\nJan discovered the Cisco Meraki solution while researching how universities, hospitals, and other industries were overcoming similar challenges. A few hours after contacting Meraki, Jan was working with a local partner in Switzerland to learn more about the cloud-managed solution. Although he had been looking into other solutions, when Meraki sent him free networking devices to trial in his environment and worked with him to establish optimal configurations, he was sold. \u201cMeraki was able to understand our case as a school. And it\u2019s easy to use,\u201d said Jan.\nBased on a partner\u2019s site survey of the two main buildings, the school purchased more than twenty Meraki 802.11n and 802.11ac access points, six 24 and 48 port switches, and a core UTM security appliance.\u00a0 It took electricians three to four days to install new Ethernet cabling in the buildings; however, the actual deployment of all of these devices was done in just one day. \u201cThanks to Meraki\u2019s automatic features, the deployment was quasi non-existent,\u201d stated Jan.\nAs a team of one, centralized monitoring and management of the network devices distributed throughout the buildings was a crucial selling point for Jan. The Cisco Meraki dashboard provides Jan with a multitude of ways to configure his network, including the option to completely segment his wireless network from his security and switching fabric. Using the built-in reporting, Jan can easily monitor the more than 1,300 wireless clients which pass over 3TB of data weekly.\nThanks to the reporting in dashboard, it\u2019s really easy to monitor bandwidth usage, prevent abuse during peak data times, and allow students \u2018more freedom\u2019 during downtime\nIT Manager\n\u00a0\nJan is able to take that monitoring one step further with the integrated dashboard features. As a school, Ecole Lemania has several network requirements unique to education, most importantly, the need to protect students. With Layer 7 firewall and traffic shaping features, Jan is able to set restrictions that block access to peer-to-peer traffic, as well as adult content and piracy. \u201cWe\u2019re able to monitor student devices and warn them if the usage is not correct,\u201d Jan explained. \u201cIf the student doesn\u2019t listen to the warning, we can apply a specific policy to their device which limits Internet access.\u201d\nThe ability to freely create and assign custom policies within the Meraki dashboard makes managing the various school-owned, employee-owned, and student BYOD devices even easier for Jan. One SSID is used in conjunction with the various policies which, depending on the policy, limit video, music, gaming, social web traffic, and more. \u201cThanks to the reporting in dashboard, it\u2019s really easy to monitor bandwidth usage, prevent abuse during peak data times, and allow students \u2018more freedom\u2019 during downtime,\u201d remarked Jan.\nThat same visibility and ease of management via dashboard is extended to the Meraki switches and security appliance that sit behind the wireless network. Each of the APs is connected back through onsite Cisco Meraki switches. It\u2019s extremely simple for Jan to make configuration changes remotely on a per port basis via the cloud-management platform. Using virtual stacking, without ever touching the switch, he can make fine-tuned and expansive changes to facilitate evolving needs in classrooms. There are also numerous automatic alerts configured to notify him of any possible error in the switch fabric, from an offline unit to a cable error to a newly discovered DHCP server.\nSitting at the edge of the network, the Meraki security appliance provides Jan with UTM services, eliminating his need for numerous boxes and providing cost savings. As traffic requests flow between end user devices and end destinations, they must first pass the scrutiny levels defined in dashboard. In a few mouse clicks, Jan implemented settings like automatic malware detection and IDS using Sourcefire, content filtering rules which deny\nadult content, whitelisting of permitted sites, configuring of Layer 3 firewall rules on outbound traffic, establishing cellular failover, and creating per-VLAN configurations.\nHaving complete visibility, from the user device to the network core, using a single, intuitive interface allows Jan to be proactive in his network management.

    "text": "Fifty-seven miles off the coast of Spain is the island of Ibiza, an epicenter of the electronic music scene drenched in seemingly eternal sunshine. Beginning in June of each year, the island becomes a holiday destination for hedonistic youth and vacationing fashionistas, hosting international DJs every night at nightclubs until the season concludes in October. Pacha Group, a nightclub franchise headquartered in Ibiza, has been an iconic institution of the island for over 40 years.\nIn 2012, Pacha Group opened the doors to Destino, providing epicurean visitors with an all-encompassing resort experience that typifies all that\u2019s desirable about the Ibiza lifestyle. A new concept in accommodation and entertainment, Destino combines the necessary luxuries of a high end resort\u2013 restaurants, pools, and spectacular views\u2013 with a uniquely kinetic party atmosphere that engulfs the outdoor space at dusk.\nRaul Jimenez, IT Director of Pacha Group, was tasked with the responsibility of providing Destino and its patrons with a WiFi experience as modern as the hotel itself. He needed a solution that could provide WiFi to users in public areas and hotel rooms, but also handle the more sophisticated, bandwidth-heavy applications used for the lighting and music to create an alluring outdoor nightclub every evening. Furthermore, Jimenez needed a solution fast. With only weeks prior to the important inaugural weekend for Ibiza visitors, Pacha needed to achieve a complete deployment and network configuration quickly.\nIn addition to a capable infrastructure and easy deployment, one of the most important considerations for Jimenez was being able to manage his network remotely. \u00a0After a recommendation from Nunsys, a technology solutions partner, he decided to test Cisco Meraki Cloud Networking to see if it could provide him with the capabilities he needed, while keeping the time spent monitoring the network to a minimum. \u00a0With traditional networking infrastructure, a new Pacha location would have meant allocating time and resources to being on-site periodically, which was too much for Jimenez\u2019s team to handle. But Cisco Meraki offered a compelling solution \u2014 to manage Destino\u2019s entire network via the web-based dashboard.\n\u201cWe realized we wouldn\u2019t have to grow our team to grow our network,\u201d Jimenez explained. \u201cAs a team of two, that is incredibly impressive.\u201d He decided to standardize on the Meraki solution.\nIn just one week, \u00a0Destino deployed a complete Meraki network \u2013 14 switches and 73 access points throughout the hotel, including two outdoor access points in the pool area. With a few clicks in the Meraki dashboard, Jimenez configured multiple SSIDs, segmenting guest access from secure access and offering different levels of connectivity for each user group.\nOur opening year enjoyed maximum capacity throughout the summer, and as part of the Pacha brand, we had expectations to create a flawless dreamlike club experience every night with our sound and light shows. Our Meraki infrastructure helped us achieve specialized network configurations with only a few clicks of the mouse.\nIT Director\n\u00a0\nFor example, visitors of the hotel who come to dine at Destino, use the pool, and attend concerts all access an open network using a click-through customized \u00a0splash page, enabling Pacha to capture email addresses for marketing purposes. Meanwhile, guests of the hotel access a network with higher bandwidth limits than the visitor network. They are \u00a0provided with a WiFi password from the concierge upon check-in, and at login are prompted for credentials, validated with RADIUS, to permit network access. Going forward, Jimenez plans to make the WiFi experience as interactive and immersive as possible, and plans to implement the Cisco Meraki Facebook authentication feature, allowing customers to connect to the WiFi via Pacha Destino\u2019s Facebook page with their Facebook credentials to raise brand awareness.\nIn addition, all operational functions of the hotel, from wireless printing to concierge check-in, are conducted on an internal SSID that Destino\u2019s employees connect to with WPA2-PSK authentication. The lighting crew uses a hidden SSID specific for their needs. Meanwhile, swimmers lounge to pulsating music that runs on the Internet connection provided by several outdoor access points nestled high above the ground \u00a0in three palm trees surrounding the pool.\n\u201cOur opening year enjoyed maximum capacity throughout the summer, and as part of the Pacha brand, we had expectations to create a flawless dreamlike club experience every night with our sound and light shows. Our Meraki infrastructure helped us achieve specialized network configurations with only a few clicks of the mouse,\u201d said Jimenez.\nUnlike traditional networking architectures, Meraki provides web-based diagnostics to troubleshoot the network when necessary. Formerly, being physically present for packet captures was an often inconvenient necessity. Cisco Meraki eliminated this requirement by giving engineers the ability to take short-burst packet captures on any device in any location served by Cisco Meraki equipment. Combined with the ability to remotely test for cable failures and WAN connectivity, Meraki made it far simpler to support Pacha Destino in the absence of a dedicated IT resource at the resort. Alerts inform Jimenez if a switch goes offline, long before issues can affect customers.\n\u201cAlmost 3,000 people were visiting our hotel a night and connecting to WiFi, and we never had a single complaint,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cNeedless to say, our customer satisfaction is really high.\u201d"

    "text": "Setting up a network for one branch is one thing. What happens if you have to set up a network for not only one but 250 sites? The Coop eG was founded in 1899 and is Germany\u2019s largest consumer Cooperative in food retail. Today it consists of around 200 sky and plaza supermarkets as well as of 11 plaza constructions and garden centers in Northern Germany.\nIn 2015 Gerrit Graf, IT manager at Coop had to restructure the network of all markets but wanted to gain flexibility and a full overview of his network. Read on to find out how Mr. Graf secured a high bandwidth on all locations at no extra cost with Meraki MX security devices and the Meraki dashboard.\nWhen Mr. Graf started working at Coop in 2010, the starting point of his network was an existing MPLS network of a large telecommunication company with a branch connection based on DSL and smallest bandwidths. He did not have a direct influence on the network back then. The solution was impractical: every change or an increase of bandwidth on the MPLS network was very expensive, so remote maintenance or local internet access relied on additional DSL connections. However, Coop wanted to increase the bandwidth in all locations while bundling all network requirements into one single connection, without adding unnecessary costs.\nCoop was looking for a solution that offered many features but, at the same time, offers a highly accessible and intuitive management software. Mr Graf had two options: choose a program of the producer or Meraki\u2019s cloud managed solution.\nIn 2013, Mr. Graf heard about Meraki for the first time at the NetUSE AG (\u201cNuBit\u201d) tradeshow in Kiel, a city in Northern Germany. At first, he was interested in an application of the WLAN AP. One year later, he urgently needed to find a solution for branch networking, so Mr. Graf learned more about the full functionality of the Meraki solutions at Cisco Connect 2014. Coop then tested Meraki and realized they could set up the network quickly \u2013 a key factor in their choice of Meraki.\nMeraki\u2019s cloud management is a ready-to-run, incredible practical management interface, which is also easy to manage for non-IT specialists and has supported us in many ways\n\nIT Manager at Coop\nCoop mainly works with Meraki\u2019s security appliances, the Meraki MXs. Two MX400s are used in the control center in Kiel, and one of the two devices is used as a warm spare. Coop installed the MX64 in 250 locations and connected them via Meraki\u2019s Auto VPN feature. In addition to merchandise management, e-mail and online information systems, the VPN can now be used to reliably transmit multi-media content for sales promotions and even large software updates to the computers of all branches in a very short time. Firewall settings allow Coop to provide external service providers with remote maintenance access to sites which, however, are securely segregated from the Coop intranet.\nRegular software and security updates of the operating systems or anti-virus solutions, which must be installed on the computers in all branches, can use a lot of bandwidth. The Meraki dashboard allows you how the bandwidth is being used at a glance. A QoS layer 7 traffic shaping rule can be set up in a few clicks, limiting the upload to a certain bandwidth. This ensures sufficient capacity for other applications.\nCoop is now gradually rolling out the MS220 in its supermarkets, in order to expand the new capabilities locally. Moreover, Coop is planning to purchase access points for wireless LAN in the stores. Interestingly, Coop does not only plan to set up WiFi for mobile devices of employees in shops, but also to offer it as an additional service for end customers. Coop already offered mobile payment options in the past, but some markets had such a bad 3G or 4G reception that they decided against it. : \u201c\u2026 if you offer smartphone payment but the customer has no access to the internet, that doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d, Gerrit Graf, IT manager at Coop. Offering WiFi in shops could be turned into reality with Meraki MR access points. With the help of the Meraki dashboard, Coop could then analyze visitor streams with the integrated heatmap or location analytics tool.\nWith Meraki\u2019s mobile device management solution, mobile devices can be controlled very easily in all locations.\nWith the security features of the MX Security Devices, content filtering or firewall rules can be set up for guests WiFi, so that Coop can protect its network against the abuse or attacks by third parties.\nThe IT team at Coop consists of 38 members but only has a small number of network experts. With the Meraki dashboard, configurations can be set up as templates before a device is implemented on site. These standardized presets can then be imported from the dashboard into a single device easily. This means that Coop\u2019s reduced team of networking experts can easily stay on top of their deployment.\nAfter Mr. Graf had familiarized himself with the templates, the rest was \u201c\u2026 just a walk in the park! It was very pleasant that you could break down all the infrastructure requirements on three to four templates and configure devices with them. When a new market opens, everyone in the IT team can push the configuration to the devices easily, which is very handy.\u201d (Gerrit Graf, IT Manager at Coop)\n\u201cI definitely highly recommend Meraki. The functionality of the solution covers everything we need. The configuration and the handling of the dashboard are very, very, very simple, so we can get all devices up and running quickly and easily.\u201d (Gerrit Graf, Head of IT at Coop)\nAn initial concern to bear the full responsibility for the operational security of the network itself quickly vanished.\nOur users notice that they do not notice anything. The network works and is very stable.\n\nIT Manager at Coop\nThe dashboard allows Coop to push updates automatically to all devices on Sundays without being worried. Monitoring the network on a daily basis is easy too: Mr. Graf only needs to \u201chave a brief look at the dashboard\u201d to get a full overview of his networks, which he did not have before.\nThe solution is not more expensive than the previous one, but Coop could reach even higher throughput rates because they could use the best available technology. In this respect, it is much easier to control the network and to be able to respond to all technical and site-specific requirements:\nFor me, the best feature is the full flexibility over all aspects of the network. And, at the same time, the Meraki cloud solution offers all important features to meet the needs of the user. You have to understand what you do, but you do not need a big IT team. You are flexible but can keep complexity away from the team \u2013 that was huge improvement for us!\n\nIT Manager at Coop"

    "text": "Established in 2000 and headquartered in Bengaluru, India, Narayana Hrudayalaya (also known as Narayana Health or NH) is one of India\u2019s largest hospital networks, operating 21 hospitals across the country. Providing advanced levels of care in over 30 specialties, Narayana is committed to delivering affordable, high-quality healthcare services to a broad population by leveraging its economies of scale, skilled doctors, and an efficient business model.\nAs Narayana Health continued to expand its footprint and bring new hospitals into the fold, it became clear that its existing network and IT infrastructure was not capable of meeting the requirements of an organisation of its size and complexity. As a result, Narayana Health\u2019s IT team kicked off a multi-year IT transformation project which began with a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of the company\u2019s infrastructure across all facilities.\nThe assessment uncovered some key shortcomings that were contributing to various application and network performance issues plaguing the hospital staff. For instance, the company lacked a standardised network architecture across its facilities, and many were relying on outdated networking equipment designed for smaller, less complex organisations.\nIn many of the group\u2019s hospitals, poor network connectivity, especially between floors, was a serious issue that was hampering communication and efficiency. It was clear from these and other findings that Narayana Health\u2019s existing network infrastructure needed to undergo a major transformation to be able to meet the constantly evolving needs of its staff and, most importantly, enable it to deliver an optimal patient care experience.\nSeeing a clear trend in the healthcare industry towards the rapid adoption of digital applications and technologies, Narayana realised its own digital transformation would need to be built on a strong network foundation, one that would provide the highest levels of performance, reliability, predictability, and security. After evaluating several competing options, the company selected Cisco Meraki MS and MR as its switching and campus wireless solution, as the combination was the best at meeting Narayana Health\u2019s evolving requirements across all of its properties.\n\u201cCisco Meraki was the natural choice for us. Trust, integrity, and customer service: when I think of Cisco, these are the three qualities that come to mind.\u201d\nGroup CIO at Narayana Health\nIn addition to meeting the company\u2019s technical requirements, the Meraki solution was also economical, which is vitally important for an organisation that is committed to providing affordable care to its patients. Once the decision was made, Narayana Health worked in close consultation with the Meraki Solutions team to design the organisation\u2019s new network architecture and create a deployment model that would be repeatable across all of its properties. The company then selected one of its smaller hospitals for the initial deployment of the solution. This approach enabled Narayana Health\u2019s IT team to fine-tune the installation and deployment process so it could be easily replicated for each additional site.\nEase of installation was a key benefit for Narayana Health. \u201cThe Cisco Meraki platform is plug-and-play,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cAs soon as the switch comes online, it\u2019s visible in the Meraki dashboard and policies can be enforced immediately.\u201d The dashboard also makes it simple for Narayana\u2019s IT team to manage and monitor the system across all of Narayana\u2019s hospitals, reducing operations costs and freeing up IT resources.\nNetwork security was another essential requirement for Narayana Health, and one where the Meraki solution stood out. As part of the Cisco ecosystem, the Meraki switching and wireless platform can be easily and seamlessly integrated with the Cisco portfolio of security tools, providing Narayana with a unified end-to-end view of all activity in the network.\nNarayana Health was looking for a switching and wireless solution that could be deployed rapidly, with an initial target of 10 to 15 months. Despite the scope and complexity of the project, the Meraki solution was successfully deployed across all of its 21 facilities in just nine months.\nFor Narayana Health\u2019s end users, the improvements to the user experience are significant. As staff members travel between hospitals, they no longer have to connect to the network manually. Thanks to Meraki MRs, all of the company\u2019s properties now share a common SSID. This means that whenever a staff member enters any of Narayana Health\u2019s hospitals, they are immediately connected to the Wi-Fi network and authorised on directory services, providing a seamless user experience. Guest users enjoy a similar experience. The IT department no longer needs to manually provide guests with an SSID and password. Instead, they are automatically given a time-based login credential that is only active while they are on site.\nIn addition to dramatic user experience improvements, the solution also provides Narayana Health the highest levels of enterprise-grade reliability, availability, performance, and security. For an organisation that continues to grow rapidly while performing life-critical work\u2014including several procedures and surgeries every day\u2014this transformation is crucial to the ongoing success of its business and the health and wellbeing of its patients."

    "text": "Founded in 2005 as a spin-off from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Robotics Institute, Bossa Nova develops advanced robotics technology that helps some of the world\u2019s largest retailers predict with confidence what\u2019s on their shelves. In 2018, the company acquired the artificial intelligence (AI) company, HawXeye, to further advance the AI capabilities in its products, and in 2019, Bossa Nova was named to Forbes\u2019 AI 50 list as one of America\u2019s most promising AI companies.\nThe company\u2019s newest robot, the Bossa Nova 2020, features an industry-leading AI stack and a smart 2D camera system that enables retailers to collect and process real-time intelligence about their inventory. The robots autonomously roam store aisles multiple times per day to confirm that each product is on the right shelf and has the right price. They also identify products that are out of stock. Bossa Nova robots are currently operating in over 350 stores across the U.S. and Europe, and the company has plans to grow its customer base to 1,000 stores by the end of 2020.\nAs it continues on this rapid growth trajectory, Bossa Nova has begun to place a renewed emphasis on protecting its IT infrastructure and the valuable equipment in its robotics manufacturing labs. Across its multiple office locations, Bossa Nova lacked a reliable method of monitoring environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity changes and water leaks, which put its assets and its business operations at risk. Throughout 2020, effective environmental monitoring has become even more important for Bossa Nova. With the majority of the company\u2019s IT staff working from home, it\u2019s no longer possible for them to check environmental conditions in person at regular intervals.\nTo address this challenge, Bossa Nova was looking for an environmental monitoring solution that was cost effective, easy to deploy, and could be quickly integrated into its existing IT infrastructure. The company had previously deployed stand-alone environmental sensors from another vendor, but their effectiveness was limited. It was in part because they were not tightly integrated into Bossa Nova\u2019s IT environment, including its existing monitoring tools and dashboards.\nAlready a full-stack Cisco Meraki customer with switching, wireless LAN, and security solutions, Bossa Nova decided to add two types of cloud-managed sensors to its existing deployment: the MT10 temperature and humidity sensor and the MT12 water leak detection sensor. These sensors, along with their existing Meraki solutions, could now all be managed from a single dashboard.\nMeraki makes it easy for the IT team to learn what they need to do with very minimal training. They don\u2019t need to be experts, which is great for me, because I\u2019m usually busy with other things.\nDirector of IT and Robot Communications\n\nThe company has experienced temperature-related issues in the past with its IT equipment, including heat-induced hardware failures, especially during the summer months when temperature and humidity levels can rise significantly. As a result, Bossa Nova installed the MT10 and MT12 sensors in its most important IT closets, as well as in an area where up to 15 of its robots are typically being charged at any given time.\nFor the company\u2019s IT staff, MT sensors simplify the monitoring of environmental changes across all of Bossa Nova\u2019s facilities.\nAs Bossa Nova\u2019s Director of IT and Robot Communications, Todd Shipway notes, \u201cMeraki makes it easy for the IT team to learn what they need to do with very minimal training. They don\u2019t need to be experts, which is great for me because I\u2019m usually busy with other things.\u201d\nUsing the Meraki dashboard, IT staff can now securely monitor the MT environmental sensors in real time from wherever they are. When temperature or humidity thresholds are reached or a water leak occurs, they are immediately alerted. These thresholds can be easily customized and users can choose how they want to receive notifications, for example, SMS, push notifications, and email.\nThe addition of the Cisco Meraki MT10 and MT12 sensors to Bossa Nova\u2019s IT facilities has given the company peace of mind knowing that its critical infrastructure and assets will be protected in the event of HVAC system failures, leaky pipes, severe weather events, and other adverse environmental conditions.\nIn their first few months of deployment, the MT sensors have already helped Bossa Nova avoid heat-induced switch failure on at least two occasions. Not only would these failures have cost the company more than $30,000 in hardware replacement costs, they also would have temporarily halted operations and led to days of lost productivity.\nIn addition to ensuring that business-critical systems remain functioning at all times, and helping to maximize network uptime and equipment lifespan, Meraki MT sensors are also critical to protecting Bossa Nova\u2019s R&D investment in robotics products. According to Shipway, \u201cif we didn\u2019t have a way to monitor the temperature, we could easily lose one or more robots, and at upwards of $100,000 each, that\u2019s obviously a significant cost hit for the business.\u201d"

    "text": "It\u2019s 2am, and you\u2019ve been driving for 3 hours on a German autobahn, longing for the comforts of home. MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe, the largest private operator of autobahn service stations in Germany, aims to provide just that. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year.\nHeadquartered in the German town of Nordhorn, the KMS Group is comprised of multiple companies, including MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe, KMS Fast Food (a franchisee of Burger King), KMS Gaming, and Qualitel Hotels.\nIn an attempt to redefine conventional service stations, MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe stations are thoughtfully planned spaces where eateries elicit the charm of a traditional kitchen, hotels ensure a night of serenity on long drives, and the service team exudes the congeniality of familiar friends. In addition to offering a home away from home to weary motorists, MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe provides their visitors with reliable wireless connectivity in remote and sometimes desolate areas.\nWhen Daniel Schwienheer, Network Administrator of KMS Group, was searching for a networking solution, he wanted an alternative to temperamental WiFi hotspots. What Schwienheer needed, in addition to reliability, was control over his network. Excessive use of video applications by hotel guests had resulted in bandwidth saturation, slowing network performance and spurring Schwienheer and his colleagues to search for an easily configurable management platform. The intuitive traffic shaping functionality built into the Cisco Meraki solution sparked the preliminary deployment of Cisco Meraki to two Qualitel hotel locations, and the KMS IT team quickly realized that Cisco Meraki could provide the WiFi and manageability they needed across all geographically distributed locations.\nOriginally, consumer-grade access points provided limited wireless coverage at the MAXI service stations. \u201cReliable WiFi has become an expectation by consumers. We weren\u2019t able to provide professional and reliable guest WiFi across our multiple locations in an easy to manage way,\u201d said Schwienheer. \u201cA lot of our customers at the MAXI service stations are business people, so they want wireless connectivity in order to continue doing business on the move.\u201d\nOver time, 11 MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe stations were equipped with Cisco Meraki networks, providing an easily configured and scalable network infrastructure. \u201cI was impressed with the coverage from a single AP,\u201d said Schwienheer, \u201cand even more impressed that I didn\u2019t have to configure each one individually.\u201d Plug and play hardware eliminated the time-intensive installation associated with conventional networking infrastructures, and the ability to clone network configurations, in a couple of mouse clicks, enabled seamless onboarding of each service station to the network.\nWith the deployment of Cisco Meraki to locations across the KMS Groups\u2019s locations in Germany, the company was able to provide the reliable free WiFi their customers needed, as well as a billing option to pay for higher speeds. A cloud-based solution revolutionized distributed branch networking, enabling multi-site management through a single centralized dashboard. As Schwienheer noted, \u201cfor a very lean IT team, being able to manage our entire network remotely via the Cisco Meraki dashboard without having to drive for hours to each site meant a lot.\u201d  Cisco Meraki self-provisioning hardware, automatic firmware updates, and automatic network optimization simplified a highly dispersed network.\nFor a very lean IT team, being able to manage our entire network remotely via the Cisco Meraki dashboard without having to drive for hours to each site meant a lot.\nNetwork Administrator,KMS Group\n\nWhile ease of deployment and remote management capabilities were priorities for the KMS Group, security was equally important. In connecting gaming machines to Cisco Meraki cloud managed switches, KMS was able to seamlessly bring security down to the port level. Maintaining a PCI compliant network and implementing strong access control measures were easy. \u201cWith automated PCI reports for auditing, we never have to worry about verifying our PCI compliance,\u201d said Schwienheer. Furthermore, virtual stacking\u2014stacking not requiring a physical connection between switches\u2014centralized the management of KMS Group\u2019s geographically dispersed switch network.  It permitted unprecedented visibility and allowed hundreds of switches and thousands of switch ports to be managed easily regardless of location, using the Cisco Meraki Dashboard.\nUnlike traditional networking architectures, Cisco Meraki cloud managed networking devices significantly reduced the need for on-site troubleshooting. \u201cWe used to have to be on-site to get packet captures for troubleshooting, or to check for broken cables, driving for hours to get to the source of the problem,\u201d said Schwienheer. \u201cNow, we have continuous testing for cable failures and WAN connectivity among other things, and web-based diagnostics to troubleshoot the network if we need to.\u201d Alerts inform Schwienheer if a switch goes offline, long before issues can affect customers.\nProviding wireless to customers has resulted in increased brand recognition for MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe. The Cisco Meraki dashboard is integrated with a Facebook authentication feature, allowing customers to connect to the WiFi via a company Facebook page with their Facebook credentials. As MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe found, the check-in also results in a higher frequency of meaningful customer interactions with the business\u2019s Facebook page. The ability to log into Wi-Fi with Facebook credentials enabled a \u2018social\u2019 user experience to service station patrons, permitting individuals to share their location and tag friends.\nWith a network supporting over 4,200 clients a week, Facebook authentication increased the visibility of MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe stations by promoting check-ins and consequently increasing the number of stories generated about the brand in Facebook News Feeds. In just over a year, MAXI Autoh\u00f6fe garnered nearly 27,000 check-ins and over 18,000 likes. \u201cThis has been a huge benefit for us,\u201d Schwienheer said, \u201cwell beyond the benefit of giving free WiFi.\u201d"

To accomplish this, they wanted to keep OpEx low while adding predictability to the offering. They hoped this approach would lead to a simple, fixed operational expense solution for their NaaS partners.\nMeraki and its single-pane-of-glass dashboard, along with a cloud-based hosted control plane, allows CBTS to expand their business without concern for management networks or fiber assets. In addition, the Managed Service Provider\u2019s (MSP) portal in the dashboard facilitates management of multiple customers without the traditional technical debt required for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) tools and additional headcount.\nCBTS also wanted the ability to conduct moves, adds, and change configurations on the fly without needing to manually utilize compact discs or other labor-intensive methods. For this, they use the Meraki API for mass-programmatic changes and configurations. It enables them to scale geographically without increasing cost and expand their customer base, which allows for growth in margins.\nAnother key component of the Meraki model is that service providers can safely offer co-management options with their end customers.

In terms of standardization, their customers expect visibility into how the network is performing.\nThis means they need to provide a predictable and reliable outcome with visibility from the host through the Wide Area Network (WAN) to the cloud and data center.\nWe can get clients up and running faster and customize as needed to meet users\u2019 specific requirements.\n\nCBTS Chief Innovation Officer\nCBTS fulfills these expectations with a fullstack Meraki solution, enabling additional services like Cisco DNA Spaces and Cisco Unified Communications. CBTS not only delivers a consistent WLAN, LAN, and SD-WAN experience, but also offers artificial intelligence and network insights with Spaces, MV cameras, and Meraki Insight licensing. CBTS has an 83 percent full-stack deployment rate consisting of wireless, switching, and SD-WAN.\nBeing able to offer one platform to deliver a reliable and cost-effective user experience is key for business decision makers as equipment depreciates off their financial books.\nCBTS offers these solutions in an OpEx utility model, allowing businesses to follow the Meraki upgrade path with the latest technology and features without the large capital outlays every three years. Meraki gives CBTS the perfect way to offer this end-of-obsolescence to their customers.\nCBTS is one of Cisco\u2019s fastest growing service providers in the United States, expanding at an impressive 63 percent year over year in FY20. The transport-agnostic nature of the Meraki MX device allows CBTS to migrate from a regional Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) provider to a North American-wide managed WAN provider.\nOver decades of providing WAN, CBTS had only 116 unique MPLS customers with an average site installation time of 120 days.\nSince selecting Meraki four years ago, CBTS now boasts over 600 unique WAN customers and an average site install interval of 30 days. Not only has the Meraki offering driven revenue but it also reduced their quote-to-cash interval, which lowers OpEx at the same time.\nWith the implementation of the Meraki API and webhooks, CBTS increased customer satisfaction with proactive network management and issue resolution, which decreased call volume to the Network Operations Center (NOC) and reduced time to resolution.\nCBTS also expanded its Meraki offering as the company continues to innovate. By adding value to the customer life cycle with solutions like Meraki Insights, MV Sense, and Adaptive Policy, CBTS not only increased its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), but also created a valuable reason to engage with existing customers throughout the life cycle.\nSimply put, Meraki enables CBTS to go further, grow faster, and be better than traditional managed service offerings.\n\nCBTS will continue to grow their Meraki practice in addition to incorporating new products such as Meraki MG wireless WAN, MT sensors, and VMX virtual security/SD-WAN appliance.\n\nThe NaaS offering today has hundreds of customers, all with unique topologies. Because every deployment is different, CBTS leveraged several key technical components during deployments, most notably for a 3,800-site food and retail customer that uses full-stack Meraki technology but also utilizes Cisco\u2019s Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) platform. In this unique franchise and corporate-owned store deployment, CBTS rolled out Meraki MX450s as hubs in the customer data center to book end their data networks. This centralized, consolidated solution with its strictly controlled processes is particularly valuable for non-technical workers at the franchise and corporate sites.\nThey also deployed Virtual Meraki MXs in the voice core to create a multi-path SD-WAN environment with traffic shaping and VoIP enhancements for the voice network, which includes thousands of handsets. Meraki\u2019s multi-hub design allows for intelligent load balancing and the virtual cores facilitate horizontal scaling with a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peer to a single interface on the carrier Session Border Control (SBC). Additionally, this network utilizes Meraki Wi-Fi analytics to ascertain business operational intelligence, thereby increasing revenue and target marketing.\nThrough this solution, CBTS was able to reduce downtime by 80 percent. It also proved very useful in getting a better handle on inventory control with the Meraki MX communicating with the distribution center, and the food and retail customer was able to sync its kitchen ovens to the perfect cooking temperature and time.\nWith an install pace of over 50 sites per week, the flexibility of Meraki SD-WAN offers fast implementation during off hours with no impact to the business operations, while creating a standardized approach to distributed networking.\n\nCBTS Naas Product of the Year"

    "text": "Most famously known for Angry Birds, the mobile game that has taken the world by storm with over one billion downloads, Rovio Entertainment is an entertainment media company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. Rovio has grown to 700 employees in offices around the globe and has expanded through acquisitions, partnerships, and investment into new business ventures. However, the IT team consists of just five people to manage the network and provide on-going support for this growing team.\n\u201cThe company is producing mobile entertainment products and all devices, including employees\u2019 devices, are heavily dependent on wireless network performance in their daily work,\u201d explained Kalle Alppi, IT Director for Rovio Entertainment. With such a heavy reliance on WiFi, having a reliable and robust network is crucial to their business. However, the previous network was pieced together using systems from various wireless providers, each with their own management style and each lacking visibility. \u201cWe were missing the overall control and performance statistics,\u201d explained Alppi. He needed to overhaul how Rovio\u2019s network management was being handled. A cloud-based solution would provide the IT team with added flexibility in handling a distributed, world-wide deployment without having to physically be on-site to diagnose issues or perform basic maintenance.\nRovio had previously deployed some Meraki 802.11n APs in their Los Angeles offices and were familiar with the devices, but were drawn to the 802.11ac performance. Alppi deployed both 802.11n and 802.11ac models in a test environment to assess their coverage and user experience. With 3x faster wireless speeds using enhanced modulation, double the channel bandwidth, and radios dedicated to 2.4 GHz clients, 5 GHz, and dual-band security radio, the Meraki MR34 802.11ac access points were an easy choice. \u201cWe chose Meraki because it\u2019s a promising technology,\u201d said Alppi. \u201cOur POC tests proved the product is an excellent fit for our needs.\u201d\nWith Meraki we got a unified view of all our wireless networks, improved security, performance, and analysis tools to support our business.\nIT Director\nAlppi and his team deployed the Meraki wireless solution in 4 countries and the equivalent of 17 office floors. With the assistance of an electrician and their technology partner, the optimal location for each device was decided taking certain factors into consideration, including building layout, high-density areas, and usage type. For the main office, it took the team two days to configure and install the devices and just a single day at each of the other office locations. \u201cThe physical installation was quick and straightforward,\u201d Alppi explained. \u201cThe devices are deployed to the main floor switches with several VLANs configured through single 1GB connections.\u201d\nThe benefit of this being a cloud-based solution is that at any point during the physical on-site deployment of the devices, the team could configure the network settings in their Meraki dashboard. To optimize network performance and create a secure environment, guest traffic flows through an isolated VLAN on a segmented SSID, while corporate traffic has been divided between SSIDs based on user and device type. For instance, there are separate SSIDs for devices using the 5 GHz frequency, users with specific authentication requirements, and corporate devices needing specific configurations.\nEach of the SSIDs can additionally be customized with per-client bandwidth limits, Layer 3 firewall rules, Layer 7 application firewall and traffic shaping settings, as well as a variety of other optimization settings. The granular settings enable the Rovio team to throttle down non-critical applications and prioritize those applications which are crucial to business operation. By monitoring network statistics and device usage, the team was able to fine-tune configurations in the weeks following the deployment, ensuring optimal performance and happy users. \u201cWith Meraki we got a unified view of all our wireless networks, improved security, performance, and analysis tools to support our business,\u201d Alppi explained.\nRovio is also taking advantage of Meraki\u2019s mobile device management platform, Systems Manager, on the company\u2019s Windows and Mac OS X laptops. Systems Manager permits the IT team to keep an inventory of issued devices, remotely push applications, set device-based restrictions, and enforce security policies \u2013 all from the same dashboard used for managing the wireless network. \u201cWe were lacking this feature before,\u201d commented Alppi. \u201cIt gives us many controls and reports to improve security and give better service to our business units.\u201d\nHaving a cloud-based solution was important in the initial setup and configuration of the network devices, and it continues to be an integral part of the management experience. Because each location is visible in the unified dashboard, Alppi and his team are able to remotely ensure that each site has the proper settings, while also gaining deep visibility into how bandwidth is being used by application, user, or device type and making adjustments as needed with just a few mouse clicks. Because this is a production network, they have also configured automatic alerts to be sent in the event of a wireless threat or device problem. This visibility and control provides peace of mind for the team, as well as overhead cost savings at sites without on-site IT.\nOver the past few years, Rovio has grown rapidly and with the Meraki solution, they can add capacity or add brand new locations in a matter of minutes. Any new devices they add to the network are seamlessly integrated, providing a scalable solution. Rovio is also looking into the Meraki Security Appliances, a unified threat management device that would provide added security and integrate into the same unified management they already enjoy. \u201cThe wireless network is operating smoothly and our visibility to our mobile service is better. We love the service,\u201d said Alppi. \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent fit for branch offices.\u201d"

    "text": "Actic is a Swedish fitness chain, with a vision to create a healthier society through exercise. Their clubs in Sweden, Norway, Germany and Austria are aiming to activate the entire community. By offering cardio, strength training, and group exercise, their mission is to beat their biggest competitor: the sofa.\nM\u00e5rten Hoffman, Actic\u2019s CIO, has a PhD in IT governance and years of experience with finding business value in different IT solutions, which makes him the perfect fit to drive the company\u2019s innovation strategy.\n\u201cInnovation in the gym industry has always been there, but from the technology perspective, they are quite late compared to other industries. When I joined the company, there was a point of sale computer to sell a membership with a basic 2 Megabit internet line. On the one hand, I had a lot to do to implement digital solutions, but on the other hand we had no legacy at all. We could start from scratch to build a really powerful network, choosing the best solution available on the market,\u201d M\u00e5rten explained.\n\nThe IT department of Actic currently consists of a handful of employees, serving the entire organization. On top of that, their IT partners help with support and services. M\u00e5rten and his team needed a reliable and secure solution that could provide them with enough flexibility to scale, as the company regularly acquires new clubs. Meraki could help them to fill the gaps with a network that is incredibly scalable. Cloud-managed IT by Cisco Meraki was the answer and allows Actic to run a flexible, scalable, and secure network.\nAt the time of deployment, Actic was facing a tough deadline to provide new internet connections on 120 sites in Sweden and Norway. First, they started by deploying Meraki switches and firewalls. A bit later, Germany and Austria were included and wireless was deployed across the organization\u2019s 180 sites. Their IT partner helped setting up the right configuration and tags, SSIDs, and assisted with radio planning. \u201cBefore, we actually didn\u2019t really know which equipment was connected on each of our sites. Now with Meraki, we have much more visibility on each and every aspect of our network and hardware. It improves the transparency of the entire network and makes work as a system administrator much easier,\u201d M\u00e5rten adds.\nWith Meraki, we have much more visibility on each and every aspect of our network and hardware. It improves the transparency of the entire network and makes work as a system administrator much easier.\nCIO\nAcross all of its fitness clubs, Actic is making use of Meraki wireless access points, switches, security & SD-WAN devices, endpoint management and on some locations also smart cameras. Each of these devices is centrally managed through the Meraki dashboard, giving the IT team an overview of the branch networks across Europe. On top of that, it gives them the opportunity to troubleshoot remotely. \u201cAs a non-technical person, the Meraki dashboard gives a great overview to business stakeholders in organizations. On the technical side, we use the organization overview every day to see if there are any problems at any of the locations,\u201d says M\u00e5rten.\nIn the Meraki dashboard, the team is extensively using the option to tag their devices and networks. Tagging makes it easy to filter, which means that M\u00e5rten and his team can see an overview of all their networks, for example, in Sweden in just a few seconds. Another way they use this feature is by tagging local internet and phone service providers or sites using a specific type of hardware or features, which makes it easy to plan and reach out when needed.\nWhen necessary, troubleshooting the Actic networks usually starts on the level of the MX security & SD-WAN appliances. Furthermore, they use the \u2018clients page\u2019 to explore bandwidth issues from an MS switch perspective, which offers the possibility to restrict bandwidth use for certain clients or applications.\nOn the MR access points, multiple SSIDs have been configured to separate staff traffic from visitor traffic. Members will see a splash page upon connecting to the network, asking them to accept the terms and conditions. The wireless technology helps Actic with business-driven decision making as well: location analytics can show on an aggregated level how devices move throughout the facilities, which can help the clubs to decide which equipment purchases to prioritize. In the future, APIs will play a bigger role at Actic to improve data accuracy.\nThe Meraki endpoint management solution, Systems Manager, is currently installed on about 150 iPads across the different clubs. These devices are mainly used for member management and in the future to sell memberships as well. With Systems Manager, the team can push updates to all iPads at the same time and with the help of the geofencing feature there has even been a case where an iPad was given back after it was stolen from a club.\nThe inspiring journey of Actic doesn\u2019t end here, as they are exploring how to keep innovating. Meanwhile, M\u00e5rten is spreading the word about their deployment: \u201cWhenever I need to recommend Meraki to someone, I sell the simplicity. I talk to them about the power of tagging, about doing everything right from the start. I sell it as a very powerful way of having an overview of what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. On top of that, the Meraki support team is very helpful,\u201d he adds.\nWhenever I need to recommend Meraki to someone, I sell the simplicity.

    "text": "Founded in 1968 and headquartered in Syracuse, New York, the C&S Companies provide client-focused engineering, architecture, planning, environment, and construction services. Besides the headquarters, C&S has 16 regional locations throughout the country, some of which are connected via MPLS. Initially only the Syracuse office was equipped with WiFi, but as BYOD hit the workplace, it became paramount to offer wireless in every office.\n\u201cEmployees had their own devices and wanted to be able to connect,\u201d explained Jim Harter, Network Administrator at C&S Companies. \u201cAnd we have a lot of vendors bringing in their own equipment, and we found that they were plugging in, which went against our corporate security policy. We have a fairly open environment, so I wanted to provide access for everyone.\u201d However, with stringent security requirements at C&S, it was critical that the wireless network be completely segregated from the corporate LAN. \u201cI was really afraid that somebody would find a way to get onto our central network,\u201d Harter said.\nHarter considered several options, including installing a separate Internet connection at each office. \u201cThat would have been a monthly data bill on top of the hardware costs \u2014 it didn\u2019t fit our business model,\u201d he said. He had been using traditional access points (APs) for wireless at the Syracuse office but, he said, \u201cin addition to being expensive, the management was complicated and I had to hire a specialist any time I needed to change configurations. It wasn\u2019t something we could scale for other locations.\u201d\nI future proof my purchases as much as possible and in the future we\u2019re going to grow. Meraki gives us the option to evolve down the road.\nNetwork Administrator\n\n\u00a0\nStill, Harter evaluated traditional controller-based wireless solutions, but he found the management challenging across the 10 offices his small IT team was responsible for. \u201cWe wanted the centralized management,\u201d he said. \u201cAt C&S, we do things right, or we don\u2019t do them at all \u2014 we\u2019re not going to band-aid it together.\u201d\nThen Harter heard about the Cisco Meraki cloud managed networking solution from the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC), and received a recommendation from a Pennsylvania firm that also used Cisco Meraki devices. \u201cLooking at Cisco Meraki, the cost savings alone were compelling,\u201d Harter said. For the price of a traditional solution at only the Syracuse office, C&S could deploy Cisco Meraki at all of the regional offices and could manage the network over the web, without specially trained staff.\nDeployment was simple for Harter\u2019s team; they shipped each AP to a remote office, asked an employee there to plug it in, and the AP downloaded its network settings from the cloud and appeared on C&S\u2019s Meraki dashboard. \u201cThe actual configuration blew us away. If I say it took 5 minutes that may actually be too long,\u201d said Harter. \u201cWe looked at each other and said, \u2018Really, that\u2019s it? That\u2019s so easy!\u2019\u201d\nCisco Meraki secure guest wireless gives Harter peace of mind, while enabling BYOD for both employees and vendors. \u201cMeraki APs feature a built-in firewall, which securely segregates guest devices, so they can\u2019t touch our network,\u201d Harter said. \u201cBut now everyone who needs mobile connectivity can have it.\u201d And, by providing a reliable guest network, C&S discourages vendors from causing a security breach by plugging into the LAN.\nHarter centrally manages all of the locations from Syracuse and appreciates that even if he\u2019s away, he can make a change on the network for any of the offices via the cloud-based dashboard. \u201cThe Cisco Meraki dashboard gives me insight into what\u2019s happening on the network in real time,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to know what the busiest sites are, and I like getting the automatic reports from Cisco Meraki \u2014 top applications, top clients, and so on. The reports tell us if we need to make a policy adjustment or a bandwidth adjustment.\u201d\nFor example, Harter likes that Cisco Meraki offers built-in application throttling, because the regional office Internet connections are shared resources, and all of the company\u2019s files reside at the Syracuse headquarters. Thus, if a user is streaming something, it limits the bandwidth for other users. \u201cNow I can see who is eating up the bandwidth and talk to them about it,\u201d Harter said. Meanwhile, he set a bandwidth limit of 1 Mbps per user and can shape traffic to ensure that particular applications are not tying up the network. Similarly, Meraki\u2019s built-in content filtering blocks adult content. \u201cWe were thinking about purchasing Barracuda web filters for all of the locations, but now that is one less expense and one less device to implement,\u201d Harter said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of bang for our buck with Meraki.\u201d\nWith the Cisco Meraki free mobile device management solution, Harter is also able to manage devices from the same cloud-based dashboard. He uses Systems Manager to manage company-owned laptops and remote PCs, iOS and Android tablets, as well as the Shoretel mobility router phone system at headquarters. By creating mobile profiles, he is able to allow devices to automatically join a particular network and push work applications like ArcGIS and BIM 360. He also uses Systems Manager to enable device restrictions on the tablets, such as not allowing movies or in-app purchases, and he set up web clips to enable secure login.\nBest of all, Harter says, Meraki gives C&S the ability to scale and change its network. \u201cI future proof my purchases as much as possible, and in the future we\u2019re going to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cMeraki gives us the option to evolve down the road.\u201d\nIndeed, the firm is planning on phasing out their MPLS network in favor of a complete Cisco Meraki networking suite. Using a Cisco Meraki MX400 at headquarters and MX80s at regional offices, C&S recently enabled a client VPN server with Active Directory. The built-in WAN optimization in the Cisco Meraki security appliances is also allowing C&S to replace their WAN optimization appliances with Cisco Meraki devices. C&S also uses Cisco Meraki MS42P switches for the Shoretel phone system at regional offices. With 3TB of data passing through the switches weekly, Jim really appreciates the visibility he has into his Cisco Meraki switches. The intuitive virtual stacking feature allows Harter to have fine-grained control over his ports.\nC&S now also equips teleworkers with access to corporate resources with the Cisco Meraki Z1 telecommuter appliance. Harter explained, \u201cWe had an employee working from home who needed access to GIS software and graphics located in a PC in the Syracuse office. So we just gave her a Z1, she plugged it in and then she could connect and get all the resources from home. It worked so well and it was so easy to set up.\u201d The Auto VPN feature (layer 3 IPsec site-to-site) connects the teleworkers with Cisco Meraki devices at corporate locations. Auto VPN can be set up in three clicks, meaning that Harter\u2019s team barely needed to set anything up for the device to work.\nAt job trailers, C&S started using Cisco Meraki MX60Ws to provide reliable and secure Internet access for employees and contractors. Mesh site-to-site VPN allows employees to connect directly with corporate resources, while contractors have access to guest wireless. With 3G/4G failover, the MX60Ws ensure a reliable network regardless of the Internet provider or the location. \u201cThe feedback from the field has been really good. Employees at the job trailers are able to connect to network resources. They love it! And they don\u2019t feel disconnected anymore,\u201d Harter said.\nHarter is now busy transitioning the C&S regional offices to all be equipped with Cisco Meraki devices. The most important thing to him is to maintain a seamless experience for end users, while ensuring the network is secure and easy to manage: \u201cCisco Meraki gives us the option to do just that.\u201d"

    "text": "Talbert House is a community-wide nonprofit network of services, with a focus on prevention, assessment, treatment and reintegration.  Services are provided at multiple sites throughout Greater Cincinnati for children, adults and families.  Founded in 1965, Talbert House served almost 29,000 children, adolescents, and adults in FY 2013 in over 36 programs in Brown, Butler, Clermont, Hamilton, and Warren counties in Ohio and Kenton County in Kentucky.  The services are offered to a broad-based population with the agency\u2019s mission in mind: to improve social behavior and enhance personal recovery and growth.\nBrad Gray, the network administrator for Talbert House, stresses the importance of a reliable and easy-to-manage network for the expanding organization. As a nonprofit with a community focus, the primary objective is to create a dependable service for the individuals and families in the agency\u2019s care. \u201cWhen I talk about our network\u2019s end users, I am referring to the clients that we work for every day,\u201d Gray explained. \u201cWe are very customer-service oriented.\u201d\nThese clients use both wired and wireless Talbert House kiosks and tablets to fill out personal information, and often need to use their own devices on the organization\u2019s network as well. Meanwhile, Talbert House\u2019s 850 employees require fast and dependable Internet in the office, and secure VPN access when working from remote locations. In order to provide end clients with the best overall experience, reliable web access and network management across all Talbert House properties is mission critical.\nWhen Gray first joined Talbert House, the organization hosted a variety of networking equipment from several different service providers. There was no way to centrally manage network devices or settings across all the branches. \u201cManaging the network took up a lot of valuable time,\u201d Gray reflected. Whether an entire branch or just one piece of networking equipment needed attention, \u201cwe would have to drive out to that location, connect to the device in question, make the change, and then drive back.\u201d Talbert House also had unsustainable levels of broadcast traffic, resulting from the lack of control measures. When the entire network went down due to a broadcast storm, the team decided that it was time to upgrade the Talbert House network.\nUpon researching various solutions, the remote management capabilities, scalability, and MDM that Cisco Meraki offered stood out against the competition. \u201cThe cloud availability was the big thing,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to be able to centrally manage the network from anywhere.\u201d As an organization that works closely with Electronic Medical Records and confidential patient information, HIPAA compliant network security was also a huge draw to the Cisco Meraki solution. After trialing the Cisco Meraki MX90 security appliance, MS42P switch, and a handful of 802.11n wireless access points, Gray and the Talbert House team were ready to launch a full Cisco Meraki deployment across all service locations.\nIt\u2019s hard to be responsible for 36 different sites, but with Meraki, you can see all your sites in one convenient location.\nNetwork Administrator\nGray worked with Netech, a trusted technology partner, on the initial network design and deployment. \u201cIt was absolutely the best experience,\u201d he said, also noting how easy and fast the initial set-up turned out to be with Cisco Meraki. For example, all devices are plug and play as well as self-provisioning, automatically pulling configuration and policies from the cloud. \u201cI get a new device, input the serial or order number in my dashboard, and the device automatically grabs its configuration. Then I send it out to a location and the staff there can just plug it in. There\u2019s no two or three day hold up.\u201d\nNow, Gray remotely manages all of the networks within the Talbert House organization, straight from the browser-based dashboard. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be responsible for 36 different sites,\u201d Gray said, \u201cbut with Meraki, you can see all your sites in one convenient location.\u201d Email alerts automatically go out if any device goes offline, enabling administrators to instantly know of any network outages. \u201cThe first thing I do every morning when I wake up is check my Cisco Meraki app on my phone. I look at my devices in dashboard, and know that if it\u2019s green, it\u2019s good. If it\u2019s yellow, there\u2019s something up. If it\u2019s red, it\u2019s time to do something. I always know what I\u2019m getting into.\u201d When there is a problem, he noted it can usually be fixed via the dashboard, reducing on-site visits.\nCurrently, at least one Cisco Meraki MS42P switch is installed at every Talbert House location. The industry\u2019s first cloud managed switch, the Cisco Meraki MS combines the benefits of cloud-based centralized management with a powerful, reliable access platform. Most Talbert House properties access the Internet through an IP telephone service, with clients wired into and drawing power from the MS switch ports.\nFor wireless access, over sixty MR16 wireless APs have been installed in a handful of Talbert House branches, with plans for wireless at each location in the coming months. In the administrative office, a 40,000 square foot, four-story structure with many active devices, there is now WiFi capable of comfortably supporting the high-density environment \u2013 a first for the organization. Meanwhile, at some transitional housing locations, Talbert House has set up a separate guest SSID with a billing plan, charging users for controlled access to the network.\nCisco Meraki MX Security Appliances are used by Talbert House for both network security and branch connectivity. The MX80 acts as a comprehensive security device, providing the network with custom firewall rules and VLAN routing. At some locations, the MX90 serves as an interface for the Cisco Meraki teleworker gateway, the Z1, to connect back into the organization. The Z1\u2019s Layer 3 firewall, ports for wired devices, and USB port for 3G/4G connectivity have been very helpful for Talbert House employees. \u201cWe have some team members who live in rural areas, who were previously unable to work productively from home,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThe Z1 allows them to access high speed, secure Internet, even during bad weather.\u201d\nWith Layer 7 application analysis and client fingerprinting network-wide, Talbert House now has access to network diagnostics like never before. Gray values being able to see how much bandwidth each property is using, what kind of data is passing through the network at any time, and details of individual client activity.\n\u201cWe can see if individual client traffic is work related, or if it\u2019s something we should create traffic shaping rules for or block altogether,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can blacklist devices for inappropriate use, and create a custom splash page for these users that directs them to our IT department.\u201d This unprecedented visibility has led to the creation of several group policies, with varying levels of permissions and bandwidth limits. In addition, Gray has used tagging features within the dashboard to customize network settings for each property on an as-needed basis.\nTalbert House now has greater control over facility-owned laptops and mobile devices, thanks to Systems Manager, the Cisco Meraki MDM solution. \u201cWe can lock down devices to prevent clients from accessing records other than their own, push software and other packages out to enrolled devices, and utilize the geofencing feature to notify administrators if a device is removed from a certain area,\u201d he said.\nMany of the Talbert House facilities operate 24 hours a day, offering critical services that require around-the-clock network access and management. With Cisco Meraki, Gray has noticed considerable improvement in the reliability of the network. \u201cThe uptime of our entire network has risen to above 99%,\u201d Gray said. \u201cUnless we shut it down, it\u2019s up and running.\u201d"

    "text": "With busy student centers, campus-wide events, sporting games, and bustling residence halls, high-density environments are copious at Albany State University (ASU) in southwest Georgia. In order to provide the best experience for its students and faculty members, it\u2019s critical that the school remain ahead of the curve in adopting new technologies to improve learning, collaboration, and security. This includes future-proofing their network by deploying devices compatible with the latest Wi-Fi standards, as well as moving network and physical security management to the cloud to simplify day-to-day operations. With a robust solution in place, the Infrastructure team can focus on impactful projects that directly benefit students, rather than on day-to-day configurations and troubleshooting.\n\nWhen their controller-based environment proved to be too challenging to maintain and upgrade, Noore Ghunaym, Director of Infrastructure, knew it was time for a change. After trying out Cisco Meraki MR access points in a small pilot, the team decided to deploy the cloud-managed access points (APs) across the entire campus due to their ease of deployment, simple management, and superior performance. Through the Meraki dashboard, the Infrastructure team can pre-configure all of their APs before plugging them in, making the deployment much faster than on-premise systems. The Meraki dashboard\u2019s intuitive user interface allowed them to deploy 600 APs with no prior complex network knowledge or training. If they need to add an AP to the network or replace an existing AP, they can just apply a network tag and all of the configured settings automatically transfer over, making deploying new APs extremely easy. This is especially important during large school events, where they have to meet high-density wireless demands and need to scale the network up or down depending on the situation. Ghunaym added, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to spend our time learning how to configure and troubleshoot, the cloud-based solution learns and manages the network for us, making the lives of people working for Infrastructure that much easier.\u201d\nIn our environment, we needed simplicity. We needed the ability to move quickly to solve problems and Meraki catered directly to that.\n\nDirector of Infrastructure\nWith APs deployed everywhere across campus, including lecture halls, gyms, athletics buildings, residence halls, and outdoor spaces, students and staff can access the network no matter where they are on campus. The Infrastructure team deployed the MR30H APs in residence halls to expand the ethernet for student use and provided reliable wireless where students live and work. Students and staff mainly use the secure, encrypted school network using their login credentials to authenticate, while guests, library visitors, and IoT devices use the open, public network. In the dorms, students can connect their smart TVs and gaming consoles through a simple portal with their login credentials and the device\u2019s MAC address. This method to log devices onto the network was such an improvement for students that the Infrastructure team saw a spike in students using the Wi-Fi in their dorms. Plus, with the combination of indoor and outdoor APs and the ability to focus the signal, the Wi-Fi works wherever students want to be, greatly improving the experience across campus.\nIf there are network issues, the Infrastructure team can easily use various troubleshooting tools to automatically identify the issue and resolve it. With auto channel assignment, RF analyzer, and latency visibility, the team can see if they need to accommodate for more density or make adjustments accordingly. Ghunaym added, \u201cWe can look at the dashboard overview and see the percentage of failed or successful connections and the overall latency, and decide if we need to investigate if something seems off. It also allows us to see the number and type of devices, what bandwidth they\u2019re using, and the amount of errors reported for different devices. So we\u2019re able to make adjustments accordingly to get a good balance to serve everybody.\u201d\nAs technology continues to become more advanced and numerous, ASU needed to future-proof their wireless network to meet growing network demands. Students are bringing devices to campus that have not been seen on the network before, and ensuring the school can support these new devices en masse is critical to student success. To accommodate this, Ghunaym and the Infrastructure team knew they either needed to deploy more 802.11ac Wave 2 APs and turn down the bandwidth on each to minimize interference, or start deploying 802.11ax. They chose to embrace the new standard and have less APs for better performance by deploying 802.11ax (also known as Wi-Fi 6) compatible MR55 APs in the student union, housing common rooms, and gaming areas. Students immediately noticed that the internet no longer slowed down, even when at capacity in these high-density areas, and were able to watch videos, stream music, and use social media with their friends, all at the same time. Ghunaym added, \u201cStudents have a much faster experience. They can watch videos, have their headphones in, stream music, snap \u2013 they\u2019re able to do all the things that college kids do.\u201d As new Wi-Fi 6 devices emerge, ASU is ready to meet students where they are, whether they\u2019re using older devices, or ones that require faster throughput and faster speeds to work effectively. Ghunaym said, \u201cWi-Fi 6 helps us meet throughput and speed challenges and allows us to scale our network accordingly.\u201d\nI always look forward to the new solutions, new technology, and new innovation that comes out of Meraki.\nDirector of Infrastructure\nIn order to help protect the physical safety of students, staff, and visitors, ASU wanted a reliable video camera system. They originally used a traditional DVR system, which caused many headaches for the Infrastructure team. They didn\u2019t have enough back-end storage and couldn\u2019t meet the retention needs of the university. Additionally, backing up the system was nearly impossible, especially with their small budgets. They also couldn\u2019t scale the cameras as desired, since that would require additional back-end storage and would be immensely complex. When Ghunaym discovered Meraki MV smart cameras, he couldn\u2019t believe the completely different approach that the solution brought to the table. With all footage stored directly on the camera, the need for servers and complex systems was eliminated. Instead, they can view all of the footage and make configuration changes from the Meraki dashboard; the same place they manage their APs. This game-changing architecture greatly simplified the school\u2019s camera deployment, and they began installing cameras across the campus. Based on where the cameras are located, the team can select the best model for that location, whether indoor or outdoor, wired or wireless, or varifocal or fixed lens. Plus, with granular access permissions, Ghunaym can give the campus police and fire departments and school leaders access to view the cameras as needed. This allows the police department to get their job done that much more easily and with less assistance required by the IT department.\nWith MV cameras deployed across the campus, the Infrastructure and safety teams have been able to take advantage of many unique and time saving features. With Motion Search, a user can find an incident or event in just a couple of clicks, instead of searching through hours of footage. Ghunaym added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power in being able to search the video footage simply. When the police department needs to go back and look for an incident, they can just highlight an area and the dashboard shows every time there was motion in that area. This saves the end user time and a lot of unnecessary hassle.\u201d They can also use the heat maps to see what areas are the busiest during certain times. The upgraded camera system has also helped the police department keep students safer across campus by giving them eyes into areas where they needed it. With improved video quality and analytics capabilities, they can find incidents faster and more accurately, and export footage to be used as evidence.\n\nWith a reliable wireless network and smarter camera solution in place, Ghunaym and his team can use their time on improving student and staff experiences across campus. They can focus on upgrading their classrooms to support new ways of learning, including video conferencing and remote learning, and enable teachers to be creative by removing any obstacles. Ghunaym explained, \u201cWe want everybody to be able to use technology to make their lives easier and more productive. We believe that with these advancements in wireless technology, people will be able to collaborate more and work in environments where they\u2019re comfortable instead of being tethered to one single location.\u201d With a faster, more reliable network, the Infrastructure team can focus on providing increased training, proactively reviewing analytics, and working on more impactful projects. Ghunaym concluded, \u201cI truly believe that if a student is happy in their dorm room and on campus, they can collaborate and speak with their family and friends remotely, and they don\u2019t have connection challenges or feel like they\u2019re disconnected from the world, then they will have a better experience and get to their goal of graduating and earning a degree.\u201d\nMeraki for Higher Education"

    "text": "Archipelago International is the management company behind many famous brands: Aston Hotels, Alana Hotels, Harper Hotels, Quest Hotels, Neo Hotels, Favehotel, and Kamuela Villas. Operating 125 hotels at the most visited destinations across Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Jules Brookfield, Vice President of Technology at Archipelago International and his team are tasked with providing top tier, reliable wireless access for their world-class guests while maintaining this rapidly expanding network.\nArchipelago International standardised on Cisco Meraki cloud networking for their wireless and wired networks to provide an easy to manage and scalable solution. Brookfield and his team evaluated other solutions, but found them cumbersome and expensive. \u201cUpgrading to Cisco Meraki was a huge leap in the evolution of networking technology,\u201d explains Brookfield.\nToday, Archipelago International has Meraki MR Wireless APs, Meraki MS Switches, and MX Security devices deployed across all sites, allowing Brookfield and his team to effectively manage and audit their hotels using the Meraki dashboard. \u201cIts great to be able to remotely look at a hotel and drill down the whole chain \u2013 from the client to the MR AP, and then to the MS Switch and finally to the MX Security Appliance \u2013 it allows the corporate office to easily manage all of this.\u201d\n\nThe main differentiation for Archipelago International was the dashboard and its powerful management capabilities. \u201cThe Cisco Meraki dashboard gave us exactly the information that we were looking for,\u201d Brookfield said. \u201cCisco Meraki made the complex task of serving more than 250,000 clients per week and managing thousands of access points across distributed sites painless and straightforward.\u201d\nCisco Meraki made the complex task of serving more than 250,000 clients per week and managing thousands of access points across distributed sites, painless and straightforward.\n\nVice President of Technology\n\nThe web-based dashboard offers significant, long-term labour savings because troubleshooting, diagnostics, VPN setup, and other routine daily management tasks can now be performed from Archipelago International\u2019s headquarters in Jakarta, Indonesia. \u201cThe single pane of glass is where all my hotels and all the equipment are consolidated in one place for us to review and monitor,\u201d Brookfield said.\nTasks such as remote cable testing, Rogue AP detection, and network wide configuration changes are all done instantly and automatically from the dashboard. \u201cIn the past, we had to go on-site to find a resolution for two-thirds of the issues,\u201d Brookfield explained. \u201cThe Cisco Meraki dashboard is rich with visibility, management, and troubleshooting features, considerably decreasing our need to go on-site.\u201d Now instead of spending time in transit from one hotel to another, Brookfield and his team can use the time to optimise network performance to provide better service to their customers. \u201cInstead of relying on infrequent physical hotel audits, the team can view it in the Dashboard and try to improve its performance every week.\u201d\n\nReliable access to the Internet is a significant challenge in Indonesia, and Brookfield\u2019s team hedges against downtime with Cisco Meraki MX security devices. The MX\u2019s smart load balancing, which balances traffic between two ISP connections, maximizes WAN uptime. When connectivity problems do arise, the Meraki dashboard enables Brookfield\u2019s team to troubleshoot from anywhere. He explained, \u201cEach hotel has two ISPs, and at least one ISP is the same in all hotels. If an ISP issue arises, right away we can change the settings at all affected hotels. This significantly improves our uptime because previously, we would have to contact the hotel manager, then have him drop everything and drive back to the hotel \u2014 which in Indonesian traffic can easily take 2 hours \u2014 then coach him in troubleshooting and resolving the matter.\u201d\n\nDetailed reporting features in the dashboard enable Brookfield and his team to improve the ISP\u2019s compliance with their service level agreement. He described situations when the ISP fails in the middle of the night, and the duration of the downtime is often untracked. \u201cNow with the reports in the dashboard, we can see the status of the Cisco Meraki MX security appliance \u2013 we can see green in the status bar for uptime and a section of red during downtime.\u201d With reports from each hotel, Brookfield\u2019s team can quantify and present concrete data to the ISP to improve its SLA compliance. \u201cOur ISPs are also recipients of email alerts from the dashboard. This keeps them updated on the reliability of the connection they are providing to us,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally, with the ever expanding application fingerprinting feature, the Cisco Meraki solution allows Brookfield and his team to identify traffic, such as encrypted Bittorrent, and throttle it down as needed. The Meraki dashboard allows his team to detect usage at the device level and identify those who are abusing the connection. \u201cWith more devices than ever, the ability to control usage is more important than ever,\u201d Brookfield said.\nAdditionally, Meraki\u2019s layer 7 application fingerprinting empowers Brookfield and his team to isolate usage at the client level and ensure appropriate usage for employee and customer devices \u2013 a key component in Archipelago International\u2019s networking strategy."

    "text": "Ledarna is an organisation for managers in the Swedish labor market, providing guidance and support for over 92,000 members in all types of trades and professions. Reliable communication between offices and with other companies is critical for Ledarna\u2019s daily business operations; however, their previous network solution was unable to support this need and was also lacking in visibility and control.\nWith a small IT team and six dispersed locations, IT technician Alex Tsarapatsanis needed a solution that was easy to manage and provided the granular configurations needed for each site. He discovered Cisco Meraki initially by testing Enterprise Mobility Management solution Systems Manager, and quickly realised that Meraki could also help with other challenges in Ledarna\u2019s networking infrastructure.\nAlex\u2019s team participated in a webinar to learn more about cloud-managed networking. After attending, they received a free MR access point as part of the program, and started testing it in their office environment.\nI noticed immediately that this was what I\u2019d been looking for.\nIT Architect\n\n\u00a0\nBefore, Alex and his team didn\u2019t have a management tool to look after their network- it would have been a purchased add-on, and even then, it would likely be difficult and time consuming to use. If there was a network issue, the team would sometimes troubleshoot for days, or even weeks, to pinpoint the problem. More often than not, they would have to bring in an expert consultant to help solve it.\n\u201cWe heavily rely on our phone system and the quality of calls. Before there was always something wrong with both the phone system and the network. Everyone would point at each other saying it was someone else\u2019s fault,\u201d said Alex.\nTo solve this, Ledarna first switched to a more standardized communication solution: Skype for Business. However, for their internet and telephone service provider to guarantee the best quality, Alex and his team needed to implement a brand-new reliable network.\nIn just one day, Ledarna deployed more than 40 MR access points, across multiple sites, and an MX80 security appliance for core security at headquarters. Since then, two extra offices have been opened, which led to an expansion of the network as well. The team added two extra MX security appliances, and multiple new access points and 8-port to 48-port MS switches.\nThe Ledarna group consists of multiple smaller companies, some with only 10 to 20 employees. It\u2019s no surprise that these companies often don\u2019t have an IT team on-site. To help with this, Meraki devices can be preconfigured in dashboard and shipped on-site, where non-technical staff members can simply plug them in, and they work flawlessly.\nThe Meraki dashboard allows admins to set up SSIDs in just a few clicks. Ledarna\u2019s production SSIDs are configured with 802.1x authentication and routed to core switches. Two guest SSIDs are routed to the MX80 security appliance and segmented from the LAN with layer 7 firewall and traffic shaping.\nSIP traffic for voice and video applications is prioritized using Layer 7 traffic shaping with DSCP tags. Besides that, the organisation also prioritizes traffic used by Office 365 and Salesforce, their CRM platform. Some restrictions have been set up as well, such as traffic related to BitTorrent and P2P traffic. Reduced bandwidth has been put in place in case someone bypass these restrictions.\n\u201cFrom a security perspective, we use our MX64 with auto-VPN, which is a great feature. You get a very easy and standardized way to manage traffic,\u201d said Alex. \u201cEverything just flows back to the big MX here in the Stockholm office and setting all this up didn\u2019t take longer than one hour.\u201d\nLedarna also implemented a Meraki MV security camera in the reception area of their head office, which is seamlessly managed in the same dashboard. The security manager monitors the camera and can access it when he needs to with a separate login. Ledarna had two incidents where unauthorized people tried to access the first floor where the conference rooms are located. Having a camera helped them stop these break-ins \u2013 and often they don\u2019t have to go to the authorities when security breaches can be solved internally with help from Meraki\u2019s motion search feature.\n\u201cThe simplicity and visibility of the Meraki dashboard have dramatically impacted the time we spend managing and troubleshooting the network,\u201d Alex said. \u201cOf course, this has also impacted our spend, because we now have a fixed budget for networking equipment and management every year. We know exactly how much the Meraki devices and licenses cost us, with support, warranty and firmware upgrades included.\u201d\nIn the past, Alex and his team didn\u2019t have an overview of the different warranty options of their networking devices. It would also cost them a lot to have a consultant come in to solve network issues, eventually leading to replacing the hardware. Now they can contact the Meraki support team if there is ever a problem, or even if they just have a question. As an IT generalist, managing the network is only one of Alex\u2019s responsibilities, so it helps to have a great support team available if he needs information. \u201cIf I would have to summarize our experience with Meraki I would say: No hassle and peace of mind,\u201d Alex said.\nYou can pinpoint troubling areas very, very fast. It\u2019s so effortless to set up and start using it, that\u2019s the best thing about Meraki.\nIT Architect"

    "text": "Some things are just human nature\u2014like the feeling of elation you get from being surprised. So when Cadbury and Mac\u2019s Convenience Stores teamed up to reward customers for simply logging onto the stores\u2019 Wi-Fi, they knew they had created a promotion that would give them the results they needed. From what appeared to be a simple promotion on the surface, the approach was much more strategic, involving 4 companies each contributing their own area of expertise.\nMondelez International, a global leader in the food and beverage industry, led the initiative through their Shopper Futures program \u2013 a series of 90 day pilot projects that bring cutting edge startups and leading retailers together to transform the consumer retail experience. In the words of Sofia Oliveria, Senior Brand Manager at Mondelez International, the program was focused around one main purpose,  \u201cOur goal was to drive penetration with Millenials and find unique and relevant ways to reach them with our products in that moment of purchase for a high impulse category. We were curious to know, how could we effectively grab their attention and then keep them engaged and coming back?\u201d\nMondelez International teamed up with convenience store industry powerhouse, Couche-Tard, who owns Mac\u2019s and sought out state-of-the-art location-based marketing provider, Turnstyle. Together, the trifecta uncovered invaluable information about their customers and delivered highly contextual offers and rewards to drive increased traffic and purchases.\nOur goal was to drive penetration with Millenials and find unique and relevant ways to reach them with our products in that moment of purchase for a high impulse category. We were curious to know, how could we effectively grab their attention and then keep them engaged and coming back?\nSenior Brand Manager\n\n\u00a0\nTurnstyle\u2019s cloud-based Wi-Fi marketing platform, powered by Cisco Meraki access points, allowed the two retail giants to successfully map, analyze, and market to customers, generating a considerable increase in revenue and customer loyalty.\nBased in Canada, Turnstyle offers companies a chance to gain exceptional insight into customers and patrons using Wi-Fi. For Couche-Tard and Mondelez International, Turnstyle chose Cisco Meraki for ease of management and reliability. Turnstyle\u2019s VP of Partnerships and Business Development, Ryan Freeman, stressed: \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with huge customers, you can\u2019t afford to mess up. The Meraki API is extremely reliable.\u201d After an immersion period where all partners were able to learn more about each other\u2019s strengths and areas of expertise, Turnstyle retrofitted a select number of locations with Cisco Meraki APs. Because of the clonable Cisco Meraki settings and rapid zero-touch provisioning, the locations were set up and ready to go within just a few days. Turnstyle then overlaid their cloud-based Wi-Fi marketing analytics platform to provide a graphical representation of Wi-Fi users in each location. Next came the experimentation\u2026\nThroughout a 30-day period, 6 types of offers were distributed to consumers depending on visit frequency. Logging on to the Wi-Fi network at Mac\u2019s would reward visitors immediately and simultaneously serve as an opt-in to future communications with Mac\u2019s new program. Subsequent visits by opted-in customers would be recognized by the Cisco Meraki APs and trigger Turnstyle\u2019s marketing platform to deliver additional, personalized rewards and offers to customers\u2019 mobile devices\u2014all without the need for a mobile application.\nSignage outside each store advertised the promotion to ensure every customer was aware of the opportunity to score big on snacks. But no true experiment would be valid without a control. The promotion was only offered during the month of January, while December and February acted as baselines. What they discovered proved the incredible value in the dual Meraki-Turnstyle deployment.\nOver 3,244 customers opted-in to the program during January, demonstrating a massive 81% increase in sign-ins over the prior 30-day period, driven primarily by signage advertising the campaign. Turnstyle\u2019s comprehensive dashboard showed that 30% of customers used Facebook, creating a treasure trove of demographic information for the marketing team. With additional information such as age, gender, and visitor frequency, Mac\u2019s received information that could be used to tailor future marketing efforts to their primary audience.\nMost significant were the coupon redemption rates and return on the campaign. Approximately 14% of customers who received a coupon, redeemed it. This is a significant t jump from average email coupon redemption rates, which hover between just 2% and 3%. Interestingly, despite the immediate offer of a free candy bar, most coupons were redeemed within three days\u2014meaning most customers were motivated to return for a wholly separate visit to retrieve their reward.\nAltogether, customers returned to their local Mac\u2019s 25% more frequently than they had before the campaign. This is marketing at its best: actively causing a measurable change in consumer behavior. A candy bar promotion on its own may not seem revolutionary, but backing it with the power of location and behavioral data amplified results dramatically.\nFocusing strictly on return, Turnstyle was able to demonstrate the full impact of this 25% increase in customer loyalty. Assuming an average purchase of $4, across Couche-Tard\u2019s global footprint, this channel has the potential to create millions of dollars in return for a relatively small investment in technology and customer acquisition costs.\nUnprecedented in its simplicity and success, the campaign is now a respected example of the collaborative power of Turnstyle\u2019s marketing platform, Cisco Meraki Wi-Fi, and the Mac\u2019s and Cadbury brands."

Since that time, the company has grown quite rapidly, becoming the leading Greek company in this market. They have increased from a handful of employees to nearly 700 employees at 47 locations, and are assisting more than 7,000 customers daily. While their commitment to offering comprehensive solutions and services to clients has remained the same throughout this expansion, their business operations and technology needs have evolved and grown.\nIT Director George Kanios and his team had been providing stores and employees with access to a corporate LAN, but no access out to the Internet. With an increasing number of company devices, 3rd party supplier devices, and digital marketing initiatives requiring wireless access, Kanios knew a robust WiFi network was necessary for continued business transformation. After reviewing possible solutions, Kanios selected the Cisco Meraki cloud-managed offering for numerous reasons, including its scalability, centralized management over distributed locations, and built-in features that would take the company into the future.\nIn the span of just two weeks, the small IT team had all 47 branch locations equipped, configured, and running with Meraki MR32 Access Points. \u201cThe process was straightforward with no problems,\u201d explained Kanios. \u201cIt was a very easy, plug and play installation.\u201d The devices were delivered by courier to each of the stores and plugged in by an on-site employee. The team fully configured the devices remotely from the Meraki dashboard at headquarters, and was able to monitor them as they came online and downloaded their settings from the cloud.\nThese particular MR32 APs operate on the 802.11ac wireless standard and are equipped with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology, which can be used in a variety of different ways, from emitting small packets of data to receiving broadcasts from beacons. The end result is that the Bluetooth radio built into the APs can be used for pushing notifications to nearby applications or for other purposes, like asset tracking.\nWe use the technological potential of Meraki for classic corporate use, for digital marketing, and for a better customer experience.\nIT Director\n\nIn addition to the asset tracking capabilities, Kafkas is using BLE for their digital marketing efforts. Customers in proximity to  Meraki APs can receive sales offers or special notifications about store events on their devices. This permits the stores to interact with their customers through a different medium, reaching clients who may not currently be in discussions with staff members. Effectively, the BLE technology allows each of the stores to reach a broader audience, increase basket size, and be more impactful overall.\nKanios configured 2 of the 15 available network SSIDs for corporate and guest usage. For corporate devices, users associate via 802.1X RADIUS authentication and have access to both local resources and the Internet. Devices using this secure SSID include corporate-owned barcode scanners and in-store tablets used by sales staff, as well as suppliers\u2019 tablets and demo products.\nKafkas employs a variety of options for guest WiFi access, including splash pages which can be quickly customized based on current specials or promotions. Access through Facebook login is another method in which the company can promote brand awareness. Guests wishing to access the free wireless must first \u2018check-in\u2019 to the company\u2019s Facebook page, notifying their Facebook community where they are shopping. Kanios has further created Layer 7 traffic shaping rules in the Meraki dashboard, restricting traffic available to high bandwidth-consuming applications. In addition to the customers, employees and suppliers also use this guest SSID for Internet access on their personal devices, ensuring that corporate traffic is prioritized.\nWithin the dashboard, the team gains deep visibility into every aspect of the network, as well as the ability to remotely monitor and make changes as needed. \u201cA single network engineer manages the network from headquarters via the web-based dashboard,\u201d says Kanios. \u201cThe dashboard and the automatic alerts provide immediate feedback on network health.\u201d The usage reports, which can be automatically and routinely emailed to the network administrators, provide insight into network trends \u2013 which devices are commonly connecting, what are the top applications, are there any bandwidth hogs, and more. Further, using the integrated CMX location analytics in the dashboard, Kanios can easily report on customer engagement levels, such as length of store visits, and customer loyalty \u2013 information which is critical to marketing efforts, staffing decisions, and store performance.\nComplementary to usage reporting and visibility are the security features on each AP are a crucial aspect to the day-to-day operation of the overall network. \u201cEnterprise security (Layer 3 and 7 firewall rules, traffic shaping, RADIUS server) gives us flexibility,\u201d explains Kanios. \u201cIn addition to the Cisco brand, the Meraki security features were a unique consideration in choosing this solution.\u201d Built into each Meraki AP is a third radio. The radio provides RF optimization for challenging wireless locations that automatically adjusts channel and power settings. This radio also powers Air Marshal, Meraki\u2019s wireless intrusion prevention solution, which continuously scans the environment to detect and neutralize wireless security threats.\nThe Meraki devices have been working flawlessly for Kafkas and they are now looking into Systems Manager, Meraki\u2019s mobile device management platform, to extend the benefits of Meraki to other areas of the business. Employees have had an enthusiastic response to the new network which provides them better access to corporate resources and free WiFi on their personal devices. Kanios describes the customer response to be just as positive, \u201cOur customers now feel like they\u2019re at home; while they are shopping they have Internet access.\u201d Kanios is excited to see the network benefitting in-store employees, suppliers, the IT team, the marketing team, and customers as well.\n\u201cThe Meraki solution gives us a total professional solution for corporate and guest networks. We use the technological potential of Meraki for classic corporate use, for digital marketing, and for a better customer experience,\u201d says Kanios. \u201cTechnology leads business transformation and Meraki gives us a competitive advantage in the market.\u201d"

    "text": "\u201cOur customers are very tech-savvy,\u201d said Roger Mueller, Director of IT at Design Within Reach (DWR). \u201cThey\u2019re extremely leading edge. They\u2019re carrying iPhones and iPads, and they want to be able to check their email, their stocks, and the weather, no matter where they are.\u201d\nFor his part, Mueller wants these customers to be able to check their devices while sitting in an ultra-modern Design Within Reach chair. Design Within Reach is a premier furniture retailer specializing in modern design, with 47 studios nationwide.\nWhen Mueller joined DWR at the end of 2010, the company had no wireless networking, even at headquarters. A self-described \u201cwireless guy,\u201d Mueller saw an opportunity: bring WiFi into the headquarters, the distribution warehouse, and all of the stores, and demonstrate how it increased staff mobility and customer engagement.\n\u201cWireless is really a utility now, like electricity or water,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cI wanted our customers to feel at home in our stores.\u201d In addition, because DWR does not sell furniture directly from its studios, Mueller wanted to get customers onto the DWR website to see more inventory and start ordering.\nMueller heard about Meraki\u2019s cloud managed WLAN solution from friends at his previous company. After trying Meraki access points (APs) at headquarters and a few stores, he was immediately hooked on managing the entire network via Meraki\u2019s intuitive web- based dashboard.\nMueller got all 47 studios online in less than a month, without ever going onsite or hiring outside contractors. \u201cI\u2019ve installed several other vendors\u2019 solutions, and this is so much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a breeze.\u201d\nPerhaps because he is the only person directly managing the wireless network, Mueller takes particular pleasure in describing how easily he brings a new store online. \u201cFirst I punch the serial numbers into the Meraki dashboard,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I send the equipment to the store. I ask the studio proprietor to plug the AP into the switch and hang it as high as possible. Five minutes later, I ask her to take her laptop to the farthest away point and tell me how strong her signal is. The part I really love is that I can see immediately in the dashboard that the AP is connected. And I don\u2019t have to do anything else \u2013 the AP automatically downloads its configuration settings from the cloud, based on the profile I set for all the stores, and I\u2019m done.\u201d\nDWR uses a hub and spoke network architecture, sending traffic from all of the stores and the distribution warehouse back to headquarters in Connecticut. Meraki\u2019s built-in stateful firewall with user and group policies, guest access with LAN protection, WPA2-Enterprise authentication, native Active Directory integration, and rogue AP detection ensure PCI-compliant network security at all locations.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t concerned about having the guest WiFi at the studios running on the same infrastructure as the corporate network, because the NAT functionality is built in to the Meraki wireless,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way anyone can get access to my local LAN.\u201d\nAt the warehouse, the wireless network supports the scan guns used in the loading and unloading process, while other clients are blocked from accessing the LAN. At headquarters, Mueller created two secure SSIDs for corporate-owned laptops and for iPads, both of which can access the internal LAN, while a third SSID provides wireless access for guests, blocked from the local LAN.\nThe ultimate goal of the WiFi network at the studios, Mueller emphasizes, is to encourage customers to buy more furniture. Mueller created a Meraki-hosted splash page \u2013 customized with the Design Within Reach logo and a colorful image of a group of chairs \u2013 to greet customers accessing the network. From there, customers sitting comfortably in a DWR chair can visit the DWR web page to check product colors, can read their personal email, or can start building a three-dimensional room plan using DWR\u2019s custom web application, MyDeco.\nDWR recently launched MyDeco to allow customers to mock-up a room with Design Within Reach products. The application provides a 360 degree view, in full color and to scale. It\u2019s a great sales tool, Mueller says. \u201cThe studio proprietors can work with the customers to make the room really pop,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, instead of somebody buying a chair or two, they want to buy the whole room.\u201d\nJocelyn Greenberg, Studio Proprietor at the original Design Within Reach store in San Francisco, is enthusiastic about how in-store WiFi facilitates connection with her customers.\nMeraki\u2019s products give us powerful new tools to provide the security, capacity, and management that we need in a premium retail environment.\nDirector of IT\n\u201cWe want this to be a place where people come in, bring their iced coffees, and experience us as part of their lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing connected to the Internet is huge \u2013 it\u2019s a reason to stay in the studio and build a relationship with the space. Studies show that the more time someone spends in a space, the more money they spend as well. Here, customers can browse more of our products while they\u2019re actually in the space, and we have more of a chance to interact with them.\u201d\nMyDeco, of course, provides the most opportunity for customer interaction, and some DWR stores are providing in-store tablets for customers to work on. \u201cCustomers can share what they\u2019re working on in real-time, and it creates a whole different dynamic in the store,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to having MyDeco parties. This opens up new ways for us to be creative with our clients.\u201d\nMueller said he believes more technology is always better \u2013 as long as it doesn\u2019t require more headcount. \u201cWith Meraki, I\u2019m self-sufficient.\u201d\nDesign Within Reach enhances customer experience with a custom web app and nationwide in-store WiFi"

    "text": "Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No. 2 is a school based in the Southern District of Hong Kong. Established in 1982, the school offers a bilingual curriculum to foster the all-round education of 240 full-time local and international students. The school offers a campus with 24 standard classrooms, special teaching facilities such as STEAM* centres, science laboratories and a newly renovated library.\nWithout a full-time IT network administrator or a 3rd party resource, Randolph Yau, a full-time teacher of IT, Music and Mathematics at the school, is tasked to manage the computer network of the entire school. Given Mr. Yau has very limited time outside of his usual teaching duties, he required a simple, centralised and reliable networking solution that provides stable wireless coverage, secure network access, management of network devices and ultimately meets the expectations of staff and students.\nMr. Yau evaluated multiple vendors for the school\u2019s network deployment. Meraki turned out to be the obvious choice due to its full stack offering (security, switching, wireless and mobile device management) and intuitive Meraki dashboard that enables comprehensive visibility and management of the network. Another evaluated vendor once caused school-wide outages and during the down time, Mr. Yau struggled with visibility and troubleshooting tools. Also, while managing multiple vendors was not an option the rest of the vendors offering single portfolio were excluded throughout the process.\nThe school decided to deploy Meraki MR42 access points for the entire campus \u2013 at least one per classroom, and multiple access points for larger facilities (staff rooms, halls and labs). The access points are supported by Meraki MS switches, and the school\u2019s traffic flows through the Meraki MX security appliance to keep student data private and the network secure. The school also deploys Meraki Systems Manager to manage hundreds of mobile devices that access the school\u2019s network everyday, including the 200+ iPad tablets owned by the school. Mr. Yau only spent a few hours setting up the entire school\u2019s network and devices, all through the web-based Meraki Dashboard.\nIn the education sector, network reliability is the most important consideration for Mr. Yau. \u201cImagine a class delivered based on mobile devices can\u2019t connect suddenly. Students are about to lose focus, and teachers trying to figure out what\u2019s going on\u2026 Our staff will be under so much stress to bring the class back on track.\u201d Mr. Yau recalled his nightmare when the school suffered several hours of school-wide network outage with a past vendor, and is glad to have switched to Meraki as, \u201cWe have never experienced an outage since we started deploying Meraki.\u201d\nIn addition, through the Meraki dashboard, Mr. Yau is able to set up separate VLANs for teachers and students to ensure that the bandwidth available to the teacher\u2019s network is not impacted by students\u2019 network usage. The school\u2019s network is also protected by Meraki MX content filtering that blocks inappropriate content and limits bandwidth consuming content.\nIn order to enrich the learning experience of students and to equip for the students\u2019 diverse pursuits, Stephen Li, the principal initiated a STEAM curriculum that covers Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts/Aviation and Mathematics. To support this initiative, the school digitalised the campus by building \u201cSTEAM learning centres.\u201d These are digital laboratories that allow students to learn through computers and VR headsets. Furthermore, the school invested in iPads for students to use in school or take home.\nMeraki\u2019s mobile device management solution, System Manager, is deployed in order to easily manage the mobile devices used to support STEAM learning. Teachers are able to push digital content to the staff\u2019s and student\u2019s devices in one go, and the school is able to track the precise location of every mobile device, \u201cWe\u2019ve never lost an iPad. I can check the real time location of any of our iPads\u201d.\nThe technological infrastructure that the school has invested in, has greatly enriched the learning outcomes of its STEAM curriculum, allowing students to experience learning beyond the traditional curriculum. For example, a virtual flight experience is made possible. Mr. Yau is keen to learn about how evolving technology can further enhance the education experience for both students and teachers, and regards Meraki as a trusted partner in the school\u2019s digitalisation journey.\n*STEAM is an acronym that refers to the academic disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts/Aviation and Mathematics"

    "text": "Move-in day at Eastern University in suburban Philadelphia is a hectic occasion. Incoming students, accompanied by their parents, search for their new home while returning students happily reconnect with old friends. All 1,400 liberal arts students live on campus in one of seven dorms and spend the day arranging furniture, shopping for school supplies, and connecting their devices to the network to prep for their first day of classes. Until last year, however, students continuously complained about poor dorm network connectivity, making it difficult for students to complete homework assignments, play video games, and stream videos. Eric McCloy, Chief Information Officer, knew it was time to update their ten-year-old network to give students the access they expected and deserved.\nWith a very lean IT team and limited budgets, McCloy needed a solution that was easy to deploy, while also giving students the coverage they needed. When evaluating a new solution, he decided to test Meraki in the oldest dorm building. He plugged in a Meraki switch on the ground level, went up to the third story and the opposite corner of the building, and plugged in an AP into their old, faulty cabling. To his surprise, the access point not only worked, but it had full throughput. He decided to deploy Meraki switches and access points in the seven dorms and student center/dining hall, with plans to expand to the entire campus soon\n\nTo give students enough bandwidth to connect all of their devices, McCloy decided to deploy Meraki MR30H access points in every other dorm room and MR42s in shared spaces. With compact access points designed explicitly for residence halls, students can seamlessly connect to the wireless network, or plug into one of the available ethernet ports for a wired connection. By managing all of the access points through the Meraki dashboard, the IT team can easily see which access points are online or offline, and troubleshoot accordingly. McCloy added, \u201cI love the dashboard because it\u2019s either green or it\u2019s red, so I know what\u2019s going on immediately.\u201d When the access points were placed in the dining hall, they were accidentally deployed without identifiable names. Using the Meraki dashboard mobile app, he was able to go around the dining room, blink the LEDs to figure out which access point he was looking at, and rename the device based on its location.\nThe team takes full advantage of the SSID configurations. They can set a new SSID up in minutes and often use this feature for events or troubleshooting. There is the regular student network, which uses Radius authentication for students to access, a guest network, a network specifically for gaming with a pre-shared key, as well as a conference network. The team also has much more visibility into the network than they did with their previous solution. They know the average student bedtime is around 1:30 am \u2014 with the network usage ramping up around 9 pm and lasting until 2 am. At peak times, the network is running up to 60% capacity, removing their need to use traffic shaping. But if the network ever did reach capacity, the IT team could quickly limit the connections for bandwidth-hogging applications, such as video streaming, so that students could access their homework applications.\nThe troubleshooting is phenomenal. With the dashboard, I can sit down with a student who\u2019s having trouble connecting and immediately see what access point they\u2019re connected to or if they\u2019re not connected, click on any access point and see what clients are connected to it, and see what\u2019s using the highest amount of traffic.\nChief Information Officer\nThe IT team also deployed Meraki switches in the eight buildings where they have Meraki access points. Troubleshooting a Meraki switch is extremely simple through the dashboard, and McCloy often looks to see which switch ports are turning red so he can proactively solve any network problems. Generally, when troubleshooting, he starts with the access point that someone is having trouble connecting to and then clicks into the exact switch port the access point is connected to investigate. With an old campus-wide power supply, the issue is generally power-related, and McCloy can determine which part of the campus is having a power outage and get attention to that area quickly.\n\nEastern University was experiencing an enrollment crisis that began in 2015. For three years, the institution\u2019s total full-time undergraduate enrollment had dropped by 15%. As a private institution that relies heavily on tuition for operational expenditures, the university needed to find a solution. One area of opportunity was the university\u2019s retention rate: In 2015, they retained only 74% of first-year students (a 4% decline from the year prior). To support retention and protect enrollment, the university decided to invest heavily in proactive advising services, beginning with centralized advising functionality supported by Degree Analytics.\nTo facilitate this process, Degree Analytics started by measuring both class attendance and facility usage around campus. Both analytics efforts were driven primarily by data Eastern University was already collecting in its Meraki wireless network and SIS data. Leveraging Meraki\u2019s location analytics API, coupled with these two data sources, Degree Analytics was able to immediately measure class attendance and robust engagement metrics for 97% of the student population. With over 2.6 billion rows of data analyzed, 3,700 classes were measured for presence with an accuracy rate of 93%. With this level of visibility, Degree Analytics supported Eastern advisors and student life professionals in prioritizing and executing precisely targeted student services resulting in profound impacts on student retention.\n\nTwo years ago, with their previous network in the dorms, McCloy received 80 help desk tickets during the first week of school. Last year, since deploying Meraki, he only received eight in the first week. This 90% decrease in help desk tickets, paired with simplified network management, has given the IT team time back to focus on more impactful projects. McCloy said, \u201cYou freed me up to solve network issues quicker and more efficiently. We have a lot of other projects that we\u2019re working on, and not futzing around with the network is a big help.\u201d And better yet, in a recent survey conducted by the communications professor to determine student\u2019s likes and dislikes on campus, for the first year, IT was not in the last place, but rather the food in the dining hall. McCloy added, \u201cThe students are a lot happier about the connectivity this year than they have been in the past, so I\u2019m really happy about that.\u201d"

    "text": "Lined with beautiful Victorian houses, surrounded by sandy beaches, and adjoined by a historic lighthouse, Cape May in southern New Jersey welcomes visitors and residents with its local charm. Along with these landmarks, Cape May also has eight library branches serving 83,500 citizens, which provide books, movies, computer resources, and events to its visitors. To keep up with the growing number of visitors logging onto the Wi-Fi network with their own devices, more library computers being added to the wired network, as well as an aging infrastructure, Aaron Day, IT Manager and Network Administrator at Cape May County Library (CMCL), knew it was time for a network upgrade. But with limited funding and big ambitions, Day knew he would need to find additional resources to make the library dreams a reality.\n\nWith legacy Meraki access points deployed across the libraries, Day wanted to upgrade his network to support the continuing demands of library visitors. In order to fund this project, Day needed to look outside of the library\u2019s technology budget. Working with the CMCL Director and a consultant, they applied for E-rate funding to support these projects. After assessing their technology needs, Day submitted an E-rate proposal for their project, and received quotes back from various partners. Based on the discount that they receive with E-rate funding, CMCL was able to save 65% on their networking infrastructure. Without E-rate funding, Day would not be able to put forth the capital required to complete a comprehensive network upgrade.\nThe fact that I can purchase Meraki equipment, which means I can do more with my time, is facilitated by the fact that it costs less through E-rate. Otherwise, I\u2019d have to buy standard equipment and spend more time configuring and troubleshooting, instead of focusing on other projects.\n\nIT Manager and Network Administrator\nAfter receiving their E-rate funding, Day was able to deploy the new Meraki MR33 access points and Meraki MS250 switches across the library branches. The installation was very easy; they just replaced the old access points with the new ones, activated the license in the Meraki dashboard, and they were ready to go. The library has two main SSIDs, one for the public, and a private network for staff. Library visitors log onto the public network through a splash page with the library agreement highlighted, which needs to be accepted before logging on. The private staff network gives access to hosted files and other network drives. The IT team often uses the Meraki dashboard to search for clients when troubleshooting. For security reasons, they block the staff from logging their computers on the public network. Day explained, \u201cSometimes a staff member tries to connect to the public network without realizing it. We can search the computer name and tell them \u2018hey, you\u2019re connecting to the wrong network\u2019 because all of that information is right in the dashboard.\u201d They often review the number of clients to see how many people are using the Wi-Fi network and meter bandwidth and make recommendations accordingly.\nWith the ability to make configuration changes and troubleshoot the network through the Meraki dashboard, Day and his team rarely have to go onsite to the library when there is an issue. They can access everything remotely, greatly reducing the amount of time spent traveling between locations. In addition, Day also uses the Meraki app often to troubleshoot network issues. This makes drop-in visits to the branches much more seamless, since he can make changes to the network right from his phone.\nThrough the Meraki app on my phone, troubleshooting is a one minute thing instead of a 20 minute thing. It saves a lot of time, which adds up to us being able to provide a lot more physical services for the public.\n\nIT Manager and Network Administrator\n\nWith a network that is centrally managed and easier to maintain, the IT team has more time to focus on other library projects and provide new services to library members. They now have VR machines available for patrons to use as well as programs on children\u2019s computers for a more tailored kids experience. The IT team also spearheaded the building and setup of a new events portal, which showcases all upcoming library events along with a program to provide MiFi for library visitors to check out and take home. The libraries serve citizens who don\u2019t have Internet access at home, and can come to the library to use library devices or their own devices to study, watch movies, or conduct research. None of these programs would be possible without the time the IT team has saved since deploying Meraki across the libraries. Day concluded, \u201cWe do the in house work for these library projects, and then set them free.\u201d"

    "text": "The University of North Carolina college system works to provide an outstanding education for both residents and out-of-state students. One such college, The University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) serves 7,200 students across 16 academic buildings and seven residence halls. UNCP has a relentless focus on the student and faculty experience, with a mission to Change Lives Through Education. As an NC Promise campus, the University offers students in-state tuition of $500 per semester ensuring all students have access to a high-quality, affordable education. This, paired with a dedicated IT team, enables UNCP to provide the connections and access that students and staff expect across campus. But as the student population continued to grow and network expectations and bandwidth needs continued to rise, Kevin Pait, Interim CIO and Associate Vice Chancellor (AVC) for IT, and his five person network team needed a future-proof wireless solution to bring equitable and seamless access to students.\nUNCP worked with Cisco to institute a comprehensive technology solution that included their underlying network, security, VoIP, and collaboration. When Cisco acquired Meraki, Pait and his team were very interested in testing out the cloud-managed solution. They decided to conduct a proof of concept in one of their dorm buildings, deploying the cloud-managed solution in half of the building, and their legacy controller-based system in the other half. Not only did the cloud-managed access points outperform their expectations, but they also provided increased network visibility and control. Plus, with a lean network team, they wanted to be able to spend more time improving operations and providing technology services for the university, and less time on day-to-day network configurations and troubleshooting. Because of this, Pait and his team deployed over 700 Cisco Meraki MR access points in the dorm and academic buildings, and continue to upgrade their system to Meraki as needed.\nOur goal is to enable the university to fulfill its mission to change lives through education. It\u2019s about providing access and information, and we work to ensure students and staff don\u2019t encounter technical issues that prevents them from doing so.\nInterim CIO and AVC for IT\n\nIn the past, the network team leveraged outside expertise to provision, set-up, and deploy the access points. With Meraki, the complexity was removed from the wireless deployment, enabling the network team to handle it themselves. They not only upgraded the wireless across their dorms and academic buildings themselves, but can deploy new access points on demand when they need to. Kevin added, \u201cNetwork analysts can deploy Meraki with ease, enabling our team to continue operations, provide quality services, and deploy wireless at the same time.\u201d\nMeraki is simple. You\u2019ve got the analytics, troubleshooting, errors, all of those things in the dashboard that have really helped to simplify system administration.\nInterim CIO and AVC for IT\nIn the residence halls, the team deployed Meraki MR30H wireless access points in the traditional dorm buildings, and MR53 high-density wireless access points in an older apartment complex. Using the existing cabling, the team was able to install the access points with ease. Using the MR30H, students can connect wirelessly or plug into the network, allowing them the flexibility to connect to the network how they want. Students also use Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to authenticate onto the network. With a robust security solution deployed in parallel with the wireless, the university removed the policy requiring students to have anti-virus software installed, since they now know who is running up-to-date software and who is not. They can tell if there is a vulnerability on a device, and use ISE to shut the device down if there is a security threat. With half of their students living on campus, the university works to provide an at home experience for students, and reliable connectivity is an important part of that experience.\nThe academic buildings mainly use MR53 access points, with a few MR84 access points deployed outside. The university has three Wi-Fi networks, the main UNCP SSID for students and staff, which provides seamless roaming from the residence halls to the academic buildings, as well as an open guest network and Eduroam. Each semester the university sees a significant increase in bandwidth usage, motivating them to upgrade to a 10 gig connection, with plans to upgrade their redundant connection from 1 gig to 10 gig to ensure students always have the bandwidth they need.\nPait and his team have been impressed with the simplicity that Meraki has brought to the IT team. They have been able to find and resolve network issues quickly and can easily see what is going on with the network through the Meraki dashboard. Kevin added, \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough the ease of managing the system. And the flexibility; we\u2019ve been able to accomplish ubiquitous access with just a few models of APs.\u201d\nSince deploying Meraki in the residence halls and academic buildings, I never hear complaints. Right out of the gate, the student experience was excellent and our support tickets really dropped.\nInterim CIO and AVC for IT\nWith robust wireless in the residence halls and across campus, students have reliable connections everywhere they need them. Pait added, \u201cOur students are really happy in the residential areas; if you stop hearing from them, you know you\u2019re doing something right. We have high-density coverage in all of our classrooms and have not had any performance issues reported since installing Meraki.\u201d There has also been a dramatic decrease in help desk tickets since the new wireless deployment, and complaints have almost completely disappeared. Students are consistently streaming movies, chatting with friends, playing video games, and working on academics, and they are able to do all of those things without interruption. The lack of network outages has provided always-on coverage for students, improving experiences everywhere on campus.\n\nAt the beginning we were really focused on what Meraki could do in terms of the infrastructure and the ease of management, maintenance and operations. But it\u2019s just really opened up another world of opportunity.\nInterim CIO and AVC for IT\nBefore switching to a cloud-managed solution, the IT team was spending a lot of time on day-to-day network maintenance and troubleshooting. Without a large team of dedicated, highly-technical staff, this was a big challenge. Not only has the switch to Meraki alleviated the need for them to be versed in complex wireless systems, but has also freed up their time to focus on implementing operational efficiencies, delivering better services, and fulfilling other projects. Kevin added, \u201cWe love the cloud model, new features are baked in and rolled out, and we can just enjoy that and focus on providing those features to our customers rather than how to install the software on the controller. It\u2019s alleviated a lot of stress.\u201d By eliminating day-to-day network maintenance, the team now has time to focus on how they can use network analytics to inform decisions in other business units and continue improving student experiences. With visibility into traffic patterns, device usage, and the number of connected clients, the team can use analytics to make adjustments across the academic and residential departments. They aspire to use the Bluetooth beacon technology to track student activities and class attendance so they can help students succeed on campus.\nWith simplified network management and increased visibility, the network team at UNCP can continue to provide an improved experience for students and staff. As a part of their larger technology strategy with Cisco, the university is uniquely positioned to be a marquee example of integrated technologies across the nation. Kevin concluded, \u201cBecause we\u2019re a limited staff, we do not have the time or resources to focus on piecemealing a network and communication system together. We\u2019d rather have a partner that provides the research, development, and integration for us. Everything that we\u2019ve done is a part of a long-term strategy where we\u2019re able to do more with less. And Meraki is just helping us amplify that in a tremendous way.\u201d"

    "text": "With more than 6,000 students spread across five campuses and online programs, Ashland University aims to prepare students for exciting and comprehensive careers. This mid-sized private school located in Ashland, Ohio, with campuses in Columbus, Mansfield, Cleveland, and Detroit, takes multi-campus safety very seriously. From protecting the 2,600+ students who live on campus for the duration of their education, to the thousands of students commuting to remote campuses, to the teachers and staff who support daily operations, the university aims to make all campus inhabitants feel safe, no matter where they are. Therefore, when an unidentifiable male made his way into an all girls dormitory, and the security team was unable to track down the suspect due to poor video quality, the school administration knew it was time for a major security upgrade.\n\nBeyond poor video quality, Donald Tharp, Chief of Information Technology at Ashland University, and the IT and security teams had several issues with their original security camera solution. They were originally deployed more for show than for capturing video, leading to several cameras not recording video at any given time and leaving gaps in security coverage. The video they did capture had to be stored on campus in clunky servers in every building, requiring significant maintenance and making video difficult to retrieve and review. Tharp and the IT team wanted a new solution that would remove the need for on-premises storage, reliably capture important incidents, and allow for faster video review and response.\nWorking with their local partner, the team quickly decided to move forward with Cisco Meraki MV security cameras for several reasons. After the dorm incident occurred, the team needed a solution that they could purchase and deploy extremely quickly to ensure the safety of their students. With MV, they were able to deploy over 150 indoor and outdoor cameras in just a few months across their campus, ensuring the dorms, parking lots, and campus buildings were secured. They were also excited to learn that all video was stored directly on the camera, eliminating the need for servers and extra software. Tharp was able to remove all of the legacy servers, freeing up campus space and removing the need for onsite maintenance. The improved video quality and ease of access has enabled the security team to solve incidents timely and with accuracy, improving overall campus safety.\n\nSince deploying MV, the IT and security teams have been able to keep students safer and close many more cases. They can quickly search video footage to find any incident in question with just the location or time period, leading to faster response times. For example, a student vandalized a dorm building, and the security team was able to identify the person at fault and address the situation accordingly. Since several campus buildings are located in remote areas, the team takes several precautions to make sure students and staff feel safe, especially at night. The security team receives a text or email if there is motion after hours in several outdoor locations and they often monitor the parking lot cameras in the evenings to make sure everyone gets to their cars safety. During the day, students working the front desk and security personnel will monitor the cameras and can change views or zoom in on situations as needed. Right before graduation, the school received several security threats. To combat this, they simply moved several cameras to strategic locations around the ceremony, and had a security guard monitor the scene. Luckily, graduation went on without any issues.\nOverall, the security and IT teams have saved an immeasurable amount of time and effort thanks to Meraki MV. Instead of driving to distributed buildings to access complex servers and search through hours of footage, the team can log into the Meraki dashboard and immediately view footage from anywhere. This has freed up the team\u2019s time to work on more impactful projects and focus on other areas to continue improving security.\nIn the past, finding certain footage was a big problem because we only had 2 team members who would have to travel to the servers in different locations. Now, being able to do motion searches on the MV has freed up man hours and allowed those guys to do other activities.\n\nChief of Information Technology\n\u00a0\nAccording to a recent informal university survey, students now feel safer in their dorms and in the evenings because of the new cameras. Don explained, \u201cThe students get a question \u201chow do you feel about your safety and security\u201d and their response was rated higher this year than the year before, and some of the comments said that the cameras made them feel protected.\u201d Students feel much safer and more secure with the freedom to go to their dorms, walk around campus, and leave the library after hours with this added level of protection."

    "text": "Walk into any one of Brooklyn\u2019s 59 public libraries to see kids making Lego robots, adults taking computer classes, students working on homework, and members of every generation enjoying one of life\u2019s great satisfactions: the discovery of a good book. Serving Brooklyn\u2019s 2.6 million residents as the sixth largest public library system in the United States, Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) is designed to serve patrons from every neighborhood and from every walk of life. To deliver on this mission and provide an extensive number of library programs, BPL relies on zero-touch and always-on technology to meet the growing demands of library visitors.\n\nThe reliable network and library programs that BPL provides for the public did not appear overnight. Several years ago, Rawle Jackman, Manager of Technology Services, and Gerald Horton, Systems Administrator, had to be much more hands on with day-to-day network maintenance and troubleshooting. With consumer-grade equipment trying to support hundreds, or thousands, of library visitors at one time, Jackman and Horton, the mighty 2-person IT team, were constantly going onsite to distributed library branches to fix failing devices. With no way of knowing when a device was failing or if there was a problem, there were often large gaps in coverage. In addition, some iPads were available for library visitors to use, but the team had to manually place restrictions locally on each device, which was a cumbersome process. Plus, when a user tried to access a restricted function, the iPad would lock, making it unusable until the IT team went onsite to unlock it. With a growing number of libraries coming online, Jackman knew they needed a more scalable solution to give visitors reliable access to the Internet and library-owned devices, while giving the IT team the ability to centrally manage all of their branches. When Jackman saw how easy it was to deploy Cisco Meraki devices, and manage them all from the same cloud based dashboard, he decided to place Meraki access points and switches across the libraries, and control library-owned devices with Meraki endpoint management.\nI wasn\u2019t even thinking cloud back then, I was just thinking centralized management. But Meraki presented a cloud option that made so much sense, and we\u2019ve been there ever since.\nManager of Technology Services\nIn just a month and a half, BPL was able to deploy their Meraki access points at all 59 branches. This fast turn around was made possible by the ease of deployment with Meraki devices; the IT team just plugged them in and they were ready to go. This same ease of installation still comes in handy today; if an access point needs to be replaced for any reason, Horton doesn\u2019t even need to go onsite. Instead, a local technology resource specialist can just plug in the access point, and Horton can configure the hardware remotely through the Meraki dashboard.\nThe public now has a seamless experience when logging onto the Wi-Fi. When they visit any library branch with their own device, they are welcomed by a splash page that provides access to the public network, \u201cBPL Unwired\u201d. The libraries do not limit the amount of time or bandwidth that visitors can use, and they actively work to make sure users have the fastest speeds and best coverage possible. The network used to be a nice-to-have across the libraries, but now, visitors rely on it every time they visit a branch. Patrons are thrilled with the improved wireless network, and often come into the libraries just to use the public Wi-Fi.\nFor Jackman and Horton, the simplified maintenance and troubleshooting has completely removed the need to go onsite when there is an issue with the wireless. Instead, Horton can just login to the Meraki dashboard, identify the issue, and make changes in real time. Generally, if he receives a complaint, he first checks to see how many clients are actively connected to the access point in question. If multiple people are having an issue, he can simply reboot the access point remotely. If there is ever a need to troubleshoot onsite, Horton can call the local technology resource specialist, who can easily identify the access point that needs attention from the blinking LED light that Horton is controlling on the backend.\nAfter seeing how easy it was to manage the access points remotely, the team decided to deploy Meraki switches for increased visibility and additional troubleshooting tools. With Meraki switches deployed at each branch, Horton can now easily maintain the entire public network from the same interface. With the increased visibility that the switches provide, they can quickly see if a problem is with an access point, the wiring, or something else. One of Horton\u2019s favorite features is the cable test, which allows him to remotely identify if a network problem is from faulty cabling. They often take advantage of the port reboot feature, which allows them to restart a single port instead of the entire switch. The synergy the access points and switches have has improved troubleshooting, increased network visibility, and saved the team valuable time.\nIt has really simplified our deployment process. Now, we are able to configure a device without even touching it. We can place all of the necessary settings and apply all of the apps that we want to, and upon turning the device on it is configured.\nManager of Technology Services\nBPL also uses Meraki Systems Manager to centrally manage their library devices, including iPads and MacBooks. Using Apple\u2019s Volume Purchase Program (VPP) and Device Enrollment Program (DEP) in combination with Systems Manager has greatly simplified their configuration and deployment process. The team can configure devices through the Meraki dashboard before they even leave the box, leveraging an almost completely zero-touch provisioning process. They apply different configuration profiles depending on the device and how it is used. For example, the public facing iPads have more restrictions than the staff devices, including blocked access to iCloud, app installation, and saving personal data. Once the correct profile is applied with its applicable restrictions and pre-downloaded apps, the device is ready to be used by the public. The IT team can even ship new devices directly to the library branch and apply the appropriate profiles remotely. These iPads are used in a plethora of library programs, and constantly require new applications installed and settings updated, which is easy with Meraki. With Systems Manager now deployed on all library iPads, there have been no tickets regarding locked devices, giving Horton time back in his day to focus on other projects.\n\nWe don\u2019t have enough people on the IT team to be at every branch, so having a remote system allows us to do way more with less human resources, and without the ability to do that, the branches wouldn\u2019t have these programs or the proper tools to host them.\nVice President, Information Technology and Chief Information Officer\nWith Meraki access points, switches, and endpoint management, the BPL team no longer needs to spend the majority of their time troubleshooting and monitoring the network. Instead, Jackman and Horton can focus their efforts on enabling library staff to offer the best experiences for library visitors. BPL offers a wide variety of programs, classes, and ways to connect with family and friends, all helping to improve the quality of life and economic opportunities for Brooklyn\u2019s residents. Kids can participate in the Brooklyn Robotics league, where they learn to code, make Lego robots that can perform designated tasks, and compete in a competition. Ask a Tech offers personalized technology assistance \u2013 where patrons can bring in new or broken personal devices and get assistance. Free meeting rooms are available, where small businesses can conduct meetings or citizens can host community groups. Teen Tech Time creates an environment for teenagers to get together and play games with new technology. Classes are available for all age groups to help with resume building, job readiness, basic computer skills, using email, art, and more. All of these programs are creating a thriving community for Brooklyn residents to take part in, and would not be possible without the reliable endpoint management and wireless access provided by Meraki."

    "text": "With 175 state parks and coastal resources encompassing 16 million acres, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is responsible for protecting the air, water and land across the state. DEP is in charge of many areas, including land and recreation, all state parks and trails, regulatory programs for air and water quality, and ecosystem restoration to improve resources in the Everglades, Florida\u2019s many springs and other water bodies. The agency\u2019s goal is to create strong community partnerships, focus resources on projects that directly benefit the environment, and empower employees to solve problems through innovation and efficiency.\nA team of only two senior network engineers, one part-time network engineer, and two junior engineers are responsible for managing the entire Florida DEP network, from networking and voice infrastructure to telecommunication services, including video conferencing. They manage the networks at all Florida state parks and DEP field offices, as well as the headquarters in Tallahassee. The department employs approximately 4,000 people and manages over 7,000 IT devices.\n\nWith such a small IT team, they faced some unique challenges. The team is composed of people with different knowledge sets and skill levels, making it hard to deploy and maintain both the network and all of the voice infrastructure and telecommunication services. In addition, their original switching was all unmanaged, giving them zero visibility into the network. Because of this, when it came time to refresh their legacy switches, the team decided to evaluate a new solution. They were determined to find a solution that would make it easier to deploy and manage the network while providing increased visibility.\nThe DEP team researched popular switching solutions and decided to do a performance and cost efficiency evaluation between Cisco Meraki, their legacy solution, and a competitive solution. Immediately the results were clear: Meraki triumphed when it came to the speed of deployment and the ease of day-to-day management. This was key for the small IT team to continue managing the network at so many sites. Besides the sheer performance, Meraki also won on cost, allowing the agency to save on networking infrastructure and apply more of their funding directly to park services. The lifetime warranty that came with each switch cinched the Meraki choice.\nIt was time for a refresh, so we decided to look at Meraki, our existing solution, and a competitor. We had a bake-off, and Meraki won hands down when it came to deployment, the day-to-day maintenance and the cost.\n\nNetwork Engineer, Florida DEP\nAlthough the evaluation only included switching, after seeing how easy it was to manage the entire network through the Meraki dashboard, the team decided to purchase Meraki access points and security appliances as well. They began deploying all of the equipment and immediately realized several benefits.\nWith the MS220 switches, the team was thrilled with how simple it was to deploy the devices across all of the parks. They applied their standard switch template to the devices in dashboard, plugged them in, and they were ready to go. The junior engineers were able to configure and support the switches, without having the in-depth knowledge they would need to manage other brands of switches or routing infrastructure.\nThe team deployed MR72 and MR74 outdoor access points out in the field. The flexibility of user authentication, ease of installation and the simplicity of firmware upgrades were the selling features for Meraki. The wireless allows park rangers to access DEP resources and data and improve efficiency for day-to-day administrative tasks. Two SSIDs are in use, one for park rangers and one for the credit card machines to process park fees, hiking permits, and souvenirs.\nAs the majority of the state parks are located in remote locations, the team needed a way to provide secure access to the network and the proper telecommunications circuit. Initially, they could only get a DSL or other lower bandwidth connection. But after deploying the MX64 and MX65, they could capture all traffic that came in, encrypt it, and create a VPN tunnel back to their main MX100 at their headquarters in Tallahassee. This gave them the security and connection they needed to keep all the information secure.\nAcross the whole Meraki product line there is flexibility, ease of installation and deployment, and simplified firmware upgrades and maintenance \u2013 it is a single interface for managing switching, routing, wireless \u2013 the whole works.\n\nNetwork Engineer, Florida DEP\nOverall, the DEP team is thrilled with how easy it is to deploy and manage all of their Meraki products. The team uses the template feature, which allows them to drag and drop configurations onto devices, greatly simplifying and speeding up the deployment. The team spends much less time on regular day-to-day management and site configuration, leaving time to work on the telecommunications infrastructure and more impactful projects. The team has also seen a much lower call volume with network issues since migrating onto Meraki.\nThe problems we get today are not related to Meraki equipment \u2013 usually it is the carrier who dropped a circuit that caused a park site to go down, but it is never the switching infrastructure or other Meraki gear.\n\nNetwork Engineer, Florida DEP\nMeraki has also helped the team beyond just simplifying their networking. Thanks to Meraki\u2019s available documentation and set-up guides, as well as its intuitive deployment design, the team has started to simplify the work they do in other areas. They now work to \u201cMerakify\u201d the other aspects of networking and telecommunications that they manage, enabling them to work more efficiently and effectively.\n\nDEP has several projects on the horizon to continue simplifying all aspects of their networking infrastructure.\nThe parks and offices currently have video surveillance, but they want to replace the cameras with a solution that can improve safety and security for park rangers, visitors and employees. Therefore, their first project is to evaluate the Meraki MV security cameras. The ability to manage security cameras from the same interface as their other networking technology would save time and greatly simplify maintenance.\nAlthough most of the park sites are using Meraki access points, there is still some legacy equipment deployed at the headquarters. The plan is to migrate all of the wireless over to Meraki in the next couple of years. The team also intends to provide public Wi-Fi at park entrances, visitor centers, and ranger stations through a separate and secure SSID.\nThe team has several plans for their network security as well. Their first priority is to start utilizing SD-WAN. This would give them more flexibility, provide them with multiple connections coming out of their sites, and allow for traffic profiling. Because the Meraki MX comes with built in SD-WAN functionality, the team can quickly migrate their network to a MFN-2 design. The network security policies are also currently centralized in Tallahassee \u2013 the plan is to decentralize over the next few years to allow each park site faster connections and more flexibility.\nSince the team also manages voice services, they participated in a beta program for the Meraki MC phones. The SIP phones worked great for them, and the team is exploring a deployment strategy in the near future.\nAll in all, the DEP team is pleased with the Meraki purchase, and they continue to test out and deploy new Meraki products to add increased visibility through the dashboard. As Arthur concluded, \u201cThe advantages we see having a single-pane-of-glass and simplified management for all of our networking needs, all under the same umbrella, is why we continue to choose Meraki.\u201d"

    "text": "As a top-ranked regional university in the Midwest, Butler University, located on the northside of Indianapolis, is determined to ensure all of its students succeed, both while enrolled and beyond. With a focus on personalized learning, unique opportunities, and innovative technology, the school provides the best educational experience for every student. This is exemplified through Butler App, a student-focused application that engages students by allowing them to quickly find relevant campus information from their mobile devices. Students, faculty, and staff all depend on these new, innovative tools, but using such tools on campus requires a robust and reliable wireless network.\nPeter Williams, Associate Vice President of IT and Chief Information Officer, and Michael Denny, Network and Security Architect, know better than most how important reliable wireless is to today\u2019s students. Williams shared, \u201cAt a previous institution, one of the residence halls lost a boiler for a week and a half. Students were taking cold showers every day and there was not one single complaint that made the newspaper or got to the president\u2019s office. But 30 minutes without Wi-Fi and people are ready to riot.\u201d Plus, as new devices hit the market, students are some of the first people to test them out, bringing new gadgets to campus when they return from winter break or the summer holiday. Because of this, Williams and Denny realized that their 10-year-old network could no longer support the growing connectivity demanded by a constant  influx of new devices and technology on campus, so they began the search for a new wireless solution. After evaluating a few options, they selected Cisco Meraki cloud-managed wireless due to the ease of deployment, reliability, troubleshooting tools, and open platform.\nIn a week and a half, the IT team was able to install over 1,300 Meraki MR access points across the entire campus. This speed of deployment was possible because the access points (APs) were preconfigured in the Meraki dashboard before they even arrived on campus. Using the template feature and labels for device organization, the team easily applied the same configuration to hundreds of devices and installed them for immediate use. Denny added, \u201cThe moment the access points hit the network, they were active and working.\u201d Now, Meraki APs are in all dorms, academic buildings, and outdoor spaces, as well as in Hinkle Fieldhouse, a national historic landmark and one of the nation\u2019s greatest sports arenas. With their new wireless network up and running so quickly, Williams and Denny were able to quickly gain access to advanced analytics and visualization tools, which made network management and troubleshooting much easier.\nTo ensure guest wireless activity cannot take priority over academic traffic on the network, campus users have two SSID choices: the main, secure network; and a guest network. Students and staff are encouraged to connect through the main campus network, authenticating through Cisco ISE with a Butler username and password. The guest network is open for students and visitors to use, but only permits bandwidth-capped internet use.\nOne of Denny\u2019s favorite things about the cloud-managed network is the visibility it provides about network activity, which not only helps with network troubleshooting, but with school safety and accountability. Denny often uses the Meraki dashboard to locate which APs students or staff are having connectivity issues with and can identify the problem from there. With the ability to give tier two and tier three IT team members access to the Meraki dashboard, more team members can assist with troubleshooting when needed. If a student is having a connectivity issue, IT can diagnose the problem by checking the AP, its signal strength, the kind of device the student is using, and the target application. Several of the technology team members are not network engineers, yet with the Meraki dashboard, they can still help when needed. Williams added, \u201cIt enables a lot of people to troubleshoot, resolving issues much more quickly and allowing staff to pinpoint the source of the problem a lot more effectively. As the person who used to get all of these problems when no one else could solve them, it\u2019s nice that I rarely get these escalations anymore.\u201d\nAnother reason network complaints have decreased is due to the new high-density network design. With the transition to a dual-band network that utilizes bandwidth steering, devices automatically choose the less congested channel, helping to balance network traffic and ensuring users always have the best connection. They also set up the APs to ignore clients that are communicating below a certain power level, forcing the device to connect to the closest AP. In the last year, over 100,000 devices have traversed the network, which has worked seamlessly for users.\nPeople don\u2019t really say anything about the wireless now because they see it as a utility, just like the lights. It just works.\nNetwork and Security Architect\n\n\u00a0\nButler students are required to live on campus through their junior year, so having reliable wireless in the residence halls is mandatory. The majority of the campus wireless traffic comes from the residence halls, with Netflix and Youtube using over half of the bandwidth at any given time. Through the Meraki dashboard, Williams identified that the busiest time for student wireless usage was from 7 p.m. until 3 a.m., with traffic nearing bandwidth capacity during that time. To support all of the devices students bring to campus\u2013including gaming consoles, streaming devices, and other consumer electronics\u2013the team enabled multicast routing and blocked universal plug and play to stop these devices from taking the network down. Beyond this, there are no restrictions on wireless access in the residence halls, which allows Butler to provide an at-home experience, only faster for students. Denny added, \u201cStudents consume as much data as they possibly can, so the test is, can the wireless support students without getting complaints? And now, the answer is yes.\u201d\nFrom the residence halls to the academic buildings and the basketball court, students and staff now have much better connectivity across campus. Thanks to seamless roaming access and easy device onboarding, students have expressed gratitude for the improved wireless network. Even in the Fieldhouse, a venue where thousands of spectators connect wirelessly at the same time, the IT team has received great feedback about the wireless performance. In classrooms, students generally connect more than one device at any given time, and the Meraki APs supported the increased load without an issue.\nMeraki has created a lot of efficiencies for us right out of the gate. It\u2019s given us the capability to dream about what we can do going forward. Having solid wireless that\u2019s easy to configure and support allows us to take that base and use APIs to learn and interact with students differently.\nAssociate VP for the IT & Chief Information Officer\n\u00a0\nWith a reliable and high-density wireless network in place, Williams and Denny are now setting their sights on providing timely, personalized communications to students via Bluetooth Beacons and API integrations, as well as using network analytics to make informed decisions. When a student walks in range of an AP in the dining hall, student center, or science building, different communications can be pushed to that device based on location.\nBy analyzing wireless usage patterns, the university can better understand who is going to what locations on campus and how the facilities are being used. Plus, by using APIs, the school can use and interact with network data in new and exciting ways. Williams added, \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to leverage data with artificial intelligence or machine learning to deliver significant value that would never have been possible before. For us, we see this as a game changer for the future with having the capacity and capability Meraki provides.\u201d Williams and Denny also plan to use APIs to deliver a superior fan experience during Butler sporting events and ensure students have a personalized experiences no matter where they are. Williams calls this \u201cengineered serendipity,\u201d the idea that a student wouldn\u2019t know about a relevant activity unless they received the right notification at the perfect time. Williams added, \u201cWe talk about student engagement, that we want students to participate in activities, learning opportunities, experiential groups, and sporting events, all these different things. But sometimes, students can become over engaged, and that can impact their odds for success as well. So how can we expertly craft and time the interaction in a personal way that\u2019s perfect for what\u2019s going on for that student right now.\u201d\nHaving easy access to reliable, high-density wireless is just one part of the equation. The ultimate goal is to ensure students feel welcomed and connected to the university. From the time a student is admitted to the school through their graduation day, Butler aims to provide resources to make the students\u2019 journey the best it can be. The abundance and reliability of wireless has become the foundation for fun, exciting campus experiences that students and the university can use to achieve success."

    "text": "At the center of every thriving and successful community normally one thing can be found \u2013 a public library. Libraries not only provide a welcoming environment for people to read, learn, and play, but also boost the local economy by enabling students to apply for colleges, residents to find jobs, and workers to learn new skills. The Miami-Dade Public Library System knows this all too well, with a mission to provide extraordinary services, spaces, and experiences that promote literacy and learning, personal growth, and limitless opportunities for its over six million library visitors every year. With 50 libraries across the county, each unique in size, demographics, and service requirements, the IT team wanted to use data and analytics to provide personalized experiences and resources for each location. But before they could start to harness the power of data driven decision making, the libraries needed a robust networking solution that would allow seamless access to digital services for library visitors, while also providing advanced analytics for the IT team.\nWith only two people on the IT team dedicated to managing the networks for all 50 libraries, Julio Campa, Systems Support Manager at the Miami Dade Public Library System, knew they needed a networking solution that would be easy to deploy and manage. After evaluating several options, Cisco Meraki was the clear winner, with the ability to manage access points and switches from the same interface, while having increased network visibility and immediate access to built-in analytics. After seeing how easy it was to deploy and maintain the access points and switches, the team decided to also install Meraki security cameras for improved security and to be used as a sensor for additional data collection. Depending on the library\u2019s size, each location is equipped with one to 20 Meraki MS switches, one to 15 Meraki MR access points (APs), and one to 74 Meraki MV security cameras.\nWe were looking for a complete solution that could be managed centrally. Because our staff is limited, the two network administrators that maintain the security cameras also manage the switches and access points. With Meraki, we can easily scale, support, and maintain our entire system.\nSystems Support Manager\nWith new Meraki MR wireless APs deployed across the libraries, visitors can now easily log onto the Internet from their own devices or use one of the 1,000 library wireless devices, allowing them to quickly access library resources, search the web, check-out books, reserve computers, and more. By leveraging the Bluetooth beacon technology built into every Meraki AP, the IT team can send relevant notifications to visitors while they are at the libraries. Whether it\u2019s a new book release or an upcoming event, visitors will be more informed and engaged while at the libraries.\n\nSince Meraki MS switches became the network backbone for the libraries, network management and troubleshooting has become second-nature to the IT team. They were able to pre-configure all of their switches before they even left the box, making the deployment much faster than anticipated. Using the Meraki dashboard, the IT team can easily configure and troubleshoot the entire library systems switches remotely, without having to drive onsite to each location. They commonly run cable tests and use the port scheduling feature, in addition to monitoring what devices are connected to the network and from what locations, all in just a couple of clicks. Campa used to need additional tools and software in order to gain the level of network visibility the libraries needed; but with Meraki, he gets all of the information he needs right out of the Meraki dashboard.\n\nPrior to Meraki, the library\u2019s camera system was challenging to maintain and use. They had an NVR at every library for video storage, which each had to be managed onsite and could take hours to troubleshoot. They also had no way of knowing when a NVR or camera went down. After an incident, the team would go to pull the video footage, to then realize the camera had not been recording. Luckily, with Meraki MV security cameras, both of these problems were eliminated. With video stored directly on the camera, no NVRs are needed, greatly simplifying the camera deployment and ongoing maintenance. So much so in fact, that the IT Team was able to deploy all of the cameras themselves, without needing to hire a third party. Through the Meraki dashboard, the IT team can now immediately see if cameras are offline, and get them back up and running before any footage is missed.\nIn addition, the team has taken advantage of several other camera features. Using the motion search tool, the team can quickly find incidents when they do occur, without having to search through hours of footage. On one occasion, one of the libraries was vandalized, and the team was able to quickly isolate the incident, and export the footage to share with law enforcement.\nFrom the IT team, to the library security guard, to the branch manager, different people need different levels of access to the security camera system. Meraki makes this much easier than with their traditional solution; with just an email address, Campa can give appropriate staffers access to all of the cameras, or just one locations cameras. They then view the footage through the Meraki dashboard, which is accessed through a web browser on their computers or mobile phones, with minimal training needed.\nAnalytics is a bonus on top of the simplified management, excellent video quality, and easy installation.\nSystems Support Manager\nBy managing the access points, switches, and security cameras all from one dashboard, Campa and his team now have increased visibility into the network, making deploying new devices and troubleshooting that much easier. With the time saved by not having to go onsite to manage aging infrastructure, the team has put a large focus on making their libraries data gathering platforms for business intelligence and informed decision making. With the data the team collects from the network and cameras, paired with the information they gather from other library systems, they can start making informed decisions and bringing personalized services to different libraries. By knowing how many people are visiting the libraries, who is using the Wi-Fi vs accessing the library computers, how they are using library resources, and more, the Library Administration will be able to determine which areas to spend budget on and what additional services their visitors need.\nThe team is working toward building a comprehensive analytics dashboard that pulls all of this information in, digests it, and makes it presentable for the Library Administration and county officials. This will help the Library Administration justify new library services, enhancements to wired and wireless connections, and advocate for budget. Campa explained, \u201cMiami Dade county is huge, and all of our library locations are different. So by using analytics from Meraki, along with other library data, the Library Administration can use business intelligence to determine the needs at each location. The library will be able to customize programs and services for each library and the group of people that they serve.\u201d Miami Dade Public Library Systems is a pioneer in the data and analytics space for libraries across the United States, and the technologies they implement today will impact the future of digital services for residents for years to come."

    "text": "Mike Hojnicki, Chief of Technology and Administrative Services, knew large technology projects were coming when he joined New Castle County (NCC) a couple years ago. With a five person IT team responsible for supporting the infrastructure across the county, including public safety, public works, community services, land use, finance, and human resources, they desperately needed robust technology to support these critical operations. As the largest county in Delaware with over 550,000 residents and 1,600 government employees, the IT team worked 24/7 to keep the network running without interruption. But with an outdated system and very old infrastructure, the team was struggling to keep up with the demands of citizens and staff. Hojnicki knew it was time for a change. \u201cOur county executive, Matthew Meyer, challenged us with upgrading our government infrastructure to the 21st century\u201d he added. The search for a new network began.\nAs our demand for services continues to grow, and the amount of resources continues to decline, that gap is made up with technology\u2014through more efficient processes, connectivity, and solutions that solve problems.\nChief of Technology and Administrative Services\nSince IT budgets had been deprioritized in the past, the network infrastructure at NCC was in dire straits. Hojnicki worked with the Manager of Information Systems, Jon Yearly, to come up with a strategy that would make the county more efficient and properly leverage the right technology. The duo and extended IT team did extensive research, analysis, and reviews on various platforms before landing on their network provider of choice: Cisco Meraki. The NCC team worked closely with their Cisco counterparts to develop a deployment plan that included Cisco Meraki wireless, switching, and security appliances, along with Cisco Unified Communications IP phones.\nIn less than 24 short months, the lean IT team was able to research and design their new network, rewire 25 facilities, and deploy their new wireless, switching, security, and phones across the county. With their brand new network, NCC immediately saw improvements in county operations, network reliability, and user experiences.\nWhat I need is total visibility, from endpoint to endpoint, under a single pane of glass. It\u2019s the ease of administration\u2014having a command line system and dedicating a sole resource to that is just not possible. Meraki has created an environment where we can do more with less, have visibility into where our pain points are, and fix problems immediately.\nChief of Technology and Administrative Services\n\u00a0\nWith their old network, the IT team had a difficult time managing the command-line based infrastructure. Hojnicki explained, \u201cIt was cumbersome. The operating system was very hard to understand. Even bringing somebody in who had a little bit of knowledge about switches and routers, it was still a big learning curve.\u201d Since moving to a cloud-based solution, the team can now configure and manage their entire network from a web-browser, eliminating the need for a dedicated, trained resource to solely focus on network maintenance. Yearly added, \u201cI can\u2019t have a dedicated resource to watch these units and manually upgrade them. That\u2019s why we went with Meraki; now everything pretty much runs itself.\u201d Using the template feature, the team saves configurations in the cloud for their wireless, switching, and security appliances. This not only contributed to the speed and ease of deployment, but has great simplified day-to-day operations and firmware upgrades. When upgrading the public safety department, the team was worried that an outage could impact their 911 center. But to their delight, the update was so seamless that it did not impact operations.\nThe increased network visibility has also been a game changer for NCC. Through the cloud-managed Meraki dashboard, the team can see all of the devices that are connected to the network, who is using bandwidth, and where more coverage might be needed. By uploading building floor plans into the dashboard, the team can see how endpoints are moving from AP to AP and identify where someone is if they are having connection issues. The switches also provide port-level visibility, with the ability to easily add them to different VLANs. On the security appliances, Yearly added, \u201cWe now have total visibility, as if the machines were sitting right next to us, which we never had before. Instead of sending people out to sites via car to fix problems, our support desk can view these machines and access them remotely right away.\u201d\nThe improved security that Meraki products provide has helped the IT team sleep at night. On both the access points and security appliances, the team uses content filtering to block inappropriate content and protect the network from harmful sites. Using SNORT intrusion prevention, the team is safeguarded against malicious traffic, with blockers in place to protect all subnets.\nUpgrading to Meraki has not only benefited the IT team; government workers have noticed the network improvements and are taking full advantage of them. With access points located on the outside of government buildings, workers out in the field can access the network from the parking lot, making their jobs more efficient, while improving response times and public safety. The police department often uploads evidence and body camera footage from their police cars through a secure portal and government administrators access data instantaneously in case of an incident. With a faster, reliable network, government employees are empowered to be more productive, collaborate across departments, and be more mobile across government buildings. Since deploying Meraki, the IT team has received less support calls, mainly attributed to the easy network troubleshooting and increased visibility. Yearly added, \u201cWe see a problem before it happens or while it\u2019s happening and are proactive in our approach in troubleshooting, pinpointing the problem, and fixing it before people call.\u201d\nWe didn\u2019t just purchase hardware, we purchased ideas and solutions, and it has paid off.\nManager of Information Systems\nSince deploying Meraki, NCC has been inspired to continue adopting cloud solutions. By managing their entire network through a cloud-based dashboard, eliminating the mundane, day-to-day tasks of traditional networking solutions, new opportunities have opened up for team members to focus on more impactful projects. The IT team has started working to move their email, financial infrastructure, and GIS platforms to the cloud, greatly improving daily operations for employees. Without Meraki, their infrastructure would not be able to support these solution upgrades.\nAs a government organization, Hojnicki and Yearly recognize that they cannot always be on the cutting edge of new technologies in order to maintain consistent operations for critical departments. However, since moving to the cloud and deploying a reliable network, the team can focus more time on innovating and testing new technologies in controlled environments. Hojnicki and Yearly challenge their teams to push the envelope and think outside the box to grow the technology stack, continue to improve operations, and find efficiencies across the country."

    "text": "Wayne Highlands School District, located in Northeastern Pennsylvania in the Pocono Mountains, borders both the New York state line and the Delaware River. At 465 square miles, the school district is about a third the size of Rhode Island.\nDue to its size and rural profile, many schools in Wayne Highlands require scalable, easy-to-manage technology. Getting fiber optics to rural areas has historically been a challenge for the school district. Wayne Highlands\u2019 Director of Technology, Scott D. Miller, arrived at the school district in 2014 and made it his mission to redesign the district\u2019s technical infrastructure and bring advanced technology to education. \u201cTwo years ago the district had many goals we wanted to realize,\u201d says Miller. \u201cWe wanted to implement a one-to-one learning environment, and we wanted to provide robust, reliable service to students who might not have a connection at home; however, our existing network was 10 years old, and could only support basic coverage.\u201d\nCollaborating with administrative and educational leaders, Miller put together a vision for a stronger, outcome-oriented education technology environment from the ground-up. Wayne Highlands needed a new wireless network and began to look for a holistic solution that could simplify otherwise complex configuration changes and provide a unified management interface.\nThe vision came to life when Miller and his colleagues discussed the district\u2019s usage of E-rate funding. Wayne Highlands was going to receive the first year of Category Two funding, and earmarked those funds for a new, comprehensive wireless environment. Because part of the vision for Wayne Highlands was to become a \u201csmart\u201d school district with multiple touch points in the classroom, E-rate was the answer to bolstering their technological environment. \u201cOur largest goal after kicking off our search was to give students and teachers cutting edge technology, no questions asked,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIn addition to our one-to-one goals, we wanted to make sure that K to 8 children had valuable technology\u2014in particular, wireless laptop carts\u2014to give them more exposure to smart operating systems.\u201d\nWayne Highlands had already established a \u201cflipped-learning\u201d program in its classrooms, where homework is done in the classroom, and reading and lessons (such as videotaped lectures) are conducted at home. This approach, when blended with a strong wireless network provides students with a more collaborative environment to solve problems and enables teachers to engage students more deeply.\nMiller traveled to a K\u201312 education technology conference and noticed Cisco Meraki \u2013 a cloud-managed networking solution that delivers out-of-the-box security, scalability, and management to enterprise networks. Because he worked with Cisco for 20 years in his prior role, Miller was confident that Cisco Meraki was the best market offering for the school district. \u201cWe needed a long-term commitment from a technology partner,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIn reality, the genius of a strong cloud-based dashboard is that you can troubleshoot with one click and move on (even from a distance), which is extremely powerful. We have a small IT team, and Cisco Meraki stood out as a solid system.\u201d\nThe genius of a strong cloud-based dashboard is that you can troubleshoot with one click and move on, which is extremely powerful.\nDirector of Technology, Wayne Highlands School District\n\u00a0\nMiller also valued the role that Meraki support staff played as the school district looked for a new network. Starting from the first meeting at the K\u201312 conference, the Cisco Meraki team worked closely with Miller on Wayne Highlands\u2019s technology vision. The school district decided to deploy Cisco Meraki access points, switches, security appliances, and endpoint management to supply students and teacher with a robust wireless network\u2014all while providing IT staff with unparalleled visibility, ease of management, and control.\nThanks to the Meraki cloud-based dashboard, Miller and his staff were able  to program the district\u2019s core switching and wireless access points before the products even arrived in Miller\u2019s office. Miller uploaded configurations to the dashboard, ensuring that the switches were ready to launch when the products arrived. \u201cAt the very first month, as soon as our switches were connected, the core network came alive,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIt was instantaneous\u2014and we were ready to go.\u201d Three months later, the new network was completely ready for the next school year. Maintaining switches from the cloud meant that instead of laborious travel through the Pocono Mountains, Miller was able to manage the systems no matter his location, and his technicians could plug in necessary equipment from the other end.\nWayne Highlands deployed 320 access points\u2014one in every classroom\u2014to achieve high-density coverage wherever learning was taking place. Cisco Meraki radios in each AP further enabled this process by analyzing bandwidth requirements and preventing any and all bottlenecks. On top of this new classroom functionality, Miller and his team deployed voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), eliminating long-distance calls and extra transport costs.\nFrom an IT perspective, Miller and his team refocused on other priorities. Now, because access to the Internet is fast and reliable, most of the team\u2019s time is spent discussing new learning applications and curriculum, and is less consumed with network issues. \u201cWhile we\u2019re thrilled with what our staff can do, the benefits extend way beyond our team,\u201d says Miller. \u201cOur new system allows us to call a home and touch base with a faculty member, staff member, or student\u2019s family. The return on investment for children is just remarkable. Our students no longer have to plug in to the network. Now, they can be wireless instantly.\u201d\nInside the classroom, learners at all grade levels have benefited from Wayne Highlands\u2019 newly controlled network. Faculty have incorporated new, vigorous education technology curriculum into K\u201312 lessons and have added online videos, digital worksheets, and remote access to instructional content. With these new benefits, elementary learners can now trace letters and read stories remotely.\nNext up for Wayne Highlands is an expansion of the school district\u2019s one-to-one program, which is being fueled by the new network.\n\u201cWhile we are making progress in new areas, like one-to-one learning and security, our primary focus is ensuring that our students have what they need to succeed,\u201d says Miller. \u201cWe want to provide our students with everything that\u2019s available in technology and curriculum, and allow them to make great decisions for their future, and ultimately, their career path.\u201d"

    "text": "Being an early adopter of new technology is never easy. It can require a lot of research, convincing skeptical colleagues, and sometimes risking reputations. But as Emily Geisel, Director of IT at Fairborn City Schools (FCS), knows, the reward can outweigh the risk. She recommended installing an innovative cameras solution that no other school district in southwest Ohio had deployed yet and convinced school principals, local law enforcement, building administrators, and school resource officers (SRO) that it was the right choice for their district. Her efforts paid off, and now, Cisco Meraki MV smart cameras are deployed across their middle and high schools, keeping students safer and more accountable, while giving power and time back to the administration.\nLocated in a rural area with 70% of their students in the free and reduced lunch program, FCS is required to do a lot with limited resources. Because of this, implementing new technology or upgrading systems had been deprioritized, leading to outdated or non-existent systems. But as technology continued to be integrated into learning initiatives, the school administration recognized that it was time to invest in new solutions that would improve learning, collaboration, and safety. One of the first major technology projects they decided to work on was security cameras.\nFCS\u2019s old security camera systems were not designed to support a dynamic school environment. Previously, building managers were in charge of physical security, so each school had a different camera systems. The middle school only had about15 cameras, which did not provide adequate coverage even when the cameras were working. The system was not easily scalable, as adding more cameras would require additional wiring, software, and licensing. Video from the cameras was stored on a server on site, which was a challenge as the school did not have air conditioning. The high school system was made up of about 20 cameras, but the video quality was so bad it was difficult to identify who was doing what when watching footage. Ultimately, Geisel and her 2 person IT-team decided it was time to get both schools on the same platform They wanted to find a solution that would not have a single point of failure, would be easier and more accessible for SROs to use, and improve security across the schools.\nBefore beginning the search, Geisel worked to understand how the camera system would be used by the SROs, local law enforcement, and school leaders. The most common use case discussed was student discipline, so it needed to be easy to access footage and find incidents. With ongoing staffing changes, the system also needed to be easy to learn for new hires and non-technical staff. With this in mind, Geisel evaluated seven different security camera solutions. After seeing a demo of Meraki MV smart cameras, she set one up in her office to try it for herself. Geisel was blown away by the ease of deployment and use, and she was able to train others on the system in just a few minutes. The next step was to sell the security team and school leaders on Meraki. They had concerns about the new technology, and questioned why Geisel wouldn\u2019t chose a system that other nearby schools had implemented before. She pointed out the challenges that they had with servers required by on-premises systems, and the costs the district would save by not buying and maintaining a server. The local police department was quick to get on board once they saw how easy it was to access and view the video. \u201cThey looked at it and they were there like, we really like the Meraki solution. It\u2019s just so easy, and we have this app and can just log in. The police chief fully supported me going with the Meraki solution.\u201d With the police department\u2019s support, and some further persuasion from Geisel, the school district gave the approval to deploy Meraki cameras.\nThe schools are now blanketed with cameras, about 180 across the middle and high schools. They are in every corner \u2013 stairways, parking lots, hallways, cafeterias, outside, and all common spaces. FCS deployed a mix of indoor and outdoor cameras, with a couple MV32 360 degree cameras in some hallway converging points. The deployment was extremely easy \u2013 they installed the cameras in the middle school on a Friday, and they were up and running by Monday morning. Through the Meraki dashboard, Geisel configured and named all of the cameras as they were deployed, and could easily give the right access permissions to those who needed it.\nWith a comprehensive camera system in place, students are now held accountable for their actions. After an incident occurs, the SRO can use the MV cameras to quickly understand what happened, and take the correct disciplinary measures. They no longer have to rely on conflicting stories from various students. The cameras have also proved an effective preventative measure, and incidents have already started to decrease. \u201cMy new nickname from the kids is mean IT lady because I put the cameras in and they can\u2019t run wild now,\u201d Geisel shared.\nThe cameras also help in unique ways to ensure student safety. One incident Geisel shared happened right after they installed the cameras at the middle school. Some kids were playing tag outside, and one of the students knocked his head. He went to the nurse, saying he had just bumped it, but she was skeptical. The nurse asked to take a look at the camera footage, and discovered he had been unconscious for a few minutes. Realizing the student needed to see a doctor, the team quickly exported the needed footage and sent it to the doctor for review.\nSo, what has been really good? I felt like any camera system would have been good. But this one came without the headaches.\nDirector of IT, Fairborn City Schools\nNot only does the camera system deter students from misbehaving and help administrators determine what happened after an incident, but it has also completely changed the way that principals, assistant principals, SROs, and the IT team work every day.\nBefore the camera system was in place, the assistant principals were part school leaders, and part crime scene investigators. When an incident occurred, they would spend hours interviewing students, comparing stories, and trying to piece elements together to determine what happened. With the new smart camera system, they can just watch the camera footage and immediately see the entire event. With the hours saved, staff has more time to focus on impactful projects and initiatives that improve student learning. \u201cIt\u2019s been a game-changer for our assistant principals. They\u2019re saving hours every single day by not having to figure out the truth from the \u2018he said she said\u2019 stuff. They can pull all the footage and see the full story every time,\u201d Geisel shared.\nI have time to be more of an instructional leader supporting both staff and students, as the camera\u2019s ability to capture all of this information has cut time spent investigating negative behaviors by at least 50%. Thank you, Meraki, for a fantastic product that saves time, and lets us continue our efforts in an integral part of students\u2019 lives \u2013 educating them!\nFairborn City Schools\n\n\u00a0\nIn addition, the partnership between the IT team and the SRO\u2019s has changed. They use to operate in silos, but now they work together as one team to move and adjust cameras, make configuration changes in the Meraki dashboard, and continue to scale the system. Geisel explained, \u201cI was really good bonding for us, honestly because it was so easy.\u201d\nAfter the first two weeks of the camera deployment, the SROs, assistant principals, and others could easily use the cameras without help from IT. Geisel concluded, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s giving power back to our administration. I can\u2019t stress enough how easy these things are. They feel very confident and with very minimal training from me, they can go out there and get footage, and they\u2019re able to do their jobs more efficiently.\u201d\n\nMeraki for K-12\n Meraki K-12 Use Cases\nMeraki MX for Education"

    "text": "With 56 schools covering 500 sq. miles, Boulder Valley School District (BVSD), located between the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, aims to provide unparalleled technology experiences across the district for its 30,000 students and 4,000 staff. As network demands, speeds, and users continued to increase over the last few years, Andrew Moore, CIO, knew it was time to update their wired and wireless infrastructure to support the needs of the district.\n\nIn order to continue rolling out 1:1 device programs across the district and to meet the increased technology demands of students, Moore and his team needed to upgrade their outdated network and get onto the latest Wi-Fi standard. Because BVSD planned on using E-rate funding to support their project, they were required to participate in a competitive bidding process. While several solutions could meet the standard requirements, only one won the RFP and met the long term goals of the district: Cisco Meraki. Moore explained, \u201cAs a K-12 school district, we had to ensure that the solution was supportable and financially viable in the long-term. In the end, we chose Meraki because of the overall technology and it met the value proposition we were looking for.\u201d Therefore, BVSD was able to use their E-rate funding to acquire Meraki MR access points (APs) and MS switches to support the entire district.\nReplacing the wired and wireless network at 56 schools without disrupting learning was no easy task. To best allocate resources and get students on the upgraded network faster, the team flipped one to two schools each weekend until the deployment was complete. On Friday nights, they would enter a school and remove all of the old gear. Then on Saturdays and Sundays, they would install and test the new devices to ensure the school could resume as planned on Monday. APs were strategically deployed in buildings to support around 60 clients, including in classrooms, cafeterias, gyms, and open spaces. Their switching infrastructure is set up to support redundancy, with each school being connected to two sites, so that if one site goes down there are no interruptions in learning.\nEach student has devices that are connecting to our network. The densities are rising, the bandwidth is rising, and the infrastructure is now in place to handle that kind of connectivity.\nCIO\nWith some of the schools hosting 1:1 device programs, while others support BYOD, Moore needed to ensure all schools across the district had equitable access. They configured two SSIDs to support this: BVSD and guest. Students use BVSD for school-owned devices and authenticate with their school credentials. The guest SSID is available for all BYOD staff and student devices. The guest network prevents access to the main school network and requires a standard use agreement to log on. This ensures all devices that connect to the main network are properly secured. The IT team also configured a separate VLAN for maintenance devices such as air conditioners, sprinklers, video cameras, and more.\nSince completing the deployment, Moore and his team have enjoyed several benefits of their Meraki network. Through the Meraki dashboard, the IT team is able to easily spot and resolve network issues as needed. With increased network visibility, they can easily articulate to outside teams what the network problems are and help solve them. Plus, whenever there is a network issue, Moore and his team know they can count on the 24/7 Meraki support team to help troubleshoot any issues remotely. Moore added, \u201cOftentimes, for a CIO, one of the best indicators that things are working well is the lack of issues. And I can tell you that I am working at an organization with a lack of issues when it comes to our network. The tools are working well, the network is working well, and we\u2019re able to ensure the services are up and running for all of our staff and students.\u201d\n\nNumerous companies and schools are moving their computing into the cloud, but they have to have good networks to make that happen. Don\u2019t even think about moving to the cloud until your network is solid and you know it can handle the traffic and capacity you\u2019re going to put on it. I am confident that the Meraki infrastructure we have in place will be able to handle the load.\nCIO\nWhile their Meraki network has helped streamline operations for the BVSD IT team, the most important improvement for the team is the ability to support their growing number of cloud and security projects. By spending less time on day-to-day network maintenance and troubleshooting, the IT team can spend more time on impactful projects that benefit students and the entire district. This includes moving several tools and technologies to the cloud, including VoIP, Desktop as a service, learning applications, the HR system, and more. BVSD is also a leader in data privacy and cybersecurity, putting a large priority on ensuring their network is secure and cannot be hacked.\nWith their new future-proof network, BVSD is ready to take on advancements in student learning and technology availability for years to come. Students and staff are now set up to succeed, while the IT team can focus on implementing new technologies that will continue to improve classroom experiences.\n\nMR for K-12 for Wireless Learning"

    "text": "With a 13 to one ratio of students to professors, newly renovated digital classrooms, and a competitive eSports program, Illinois College provides a well rounded college experience for students. Located in central Illinois, the small liberal arts college focuses on providing innovative technology and unique programs on campus. In order to ensure that students feel safe across campus, have uninterrupted learning in classrooms, and have reliable access in dorm rooms, a robust network is required.\nAfter tiring of their traditional, controller-based hardware, Patrick Brown, CIO, and Marc Benner, Assistant CIO, decided it was time for a new network. Due to their small IT team and limited budgets, they needed a centralized, easy-to-manage solution that would eliminate the day-to-day overhead of a CLI-based network. When they discovered that Cisco Meraki was the only cloud-managed solution that was simple to configure and maintain, they decided to deploy Meraki access points, switches, and endpoint management, followed by security appliances and security cameras. Since deploying the full-stack of Meraki products, the IT team has realized several benefits.\nThe ease of deployment was a huge selling point for Brown and Benner. Without needing to configure each device with command line or stress about the complexities that go into controller-based systems, Benner deployed most of the products himself. This saved the college over $120,000 in a recent dorm Wi-Fi deployment, where they were originally going to bring in a third party to install new access points. Instead, Benner and a student were able to install the devices at almost zero cost, configuring access points through the Meraki dashboard from Benner\u2019s phone as they went.\nThe security that all Meraki products provide has been a vast improvement for the college. Before Meraki, it would take Benner over a week to go to each switch and update the firmware. With Meraki, he can simply schedule the update in the Meraki dashboard for all switches to take place in one night. They use two step authentication and password based policies for all network users, and have several SSIDs for appropriate network access. Through the security appliances, the IT team is able to block web advertisements, piracy, and cryptocurrency. Benner shared, \u201cWe recently had an issue where someone went into the eSports room, where there are powerful computers, and started using Bitcoin mining software. We saw it flagged in the Security Center as cryptocurrency, and we were able to shut it down.\u201d In addition, thanks to built-in malware protection, the amount of students with viruses on their computers has drastically decreased.\nThe security of being able to do mass firmware updates has been great. You can\u2019t tackle 100 firmware updates in a night without the Meraki dashboard.\nCIO\nThe IT team also has Meraki Systems Manager deployed on all IT devices for simplified endpoint management and increased security. Using the geofencing feature, the IT team can easily identify where devices are located, track devices if they leave a designated area, and remote wipe them if they go missing. They also use Systems Manager to deploy applications to devices with ease through the Meraki dashboard.\nOne of the unique benefits that Illinois College has experienced as they grow is that their Meraki deployment continues to scale with them. New features are continuously added to Meraki products through the cloud-based Meraki dashboard. One of Benner\u2019s favorite features on the switches, the Layer 3 capabilities, wasn\u2019t available when they first purchased them seven years ago. Now, they use Layer 3 functionality to route traffic between VLANs and create access lists to solve issues with school printers. On the Meraki MV cameras, new features have also been added since their initial deployment. The team uses the motion search feature to find important events, and can store footage based on motion, allowing them to store important footage for a longer period of time. They also take advantage of the export functionality, which allows the IT team to download a file and easily email it to the security team or police department, without having to burn the footage onto a disc like with their old solution. With motion alerts, the IT and security teams can receive alerts when there is motion in a certain frame, helping to identify security incidents much faster.\nNo matter where students go on campus, they always have seamless connections supported by Meraki. In any one of the schools 10 dorms or 15 campus houses, students can easily access the network to complete homework, surf the web, or play video games. In the dorms, every other room is equipped with a Meraki MR30H access point, while each house has an 8-port switch and a minimum of three access points. The IT team uses traffic shaping to ensure that movie streaming apps won\u2019t overtake the residence hall network. With MV security cameras placed at the entrances and exits of each residence hall, students feel safer when they come and go. Plus, since deploying Meraki in the residence halls, the number of calls from students with Wi-Fi issues has dramatically decreased.\nAs students travel from their dorm to class, students remain on the same VLAN, never having to worry about a dropped connection. In classrooms, MR52 access points can be found, with a Meraki switch on the backend, seamlessly supporting active learning classrooms. Anyone can connect to an Apple TV or Chromecast, and professors can stream online videos without a lag or unsolicited buffering.\nIn between classes, students might watch a baseball game, take a makeup test, or practice their video game skills in the eSports center. Out on the baseball field, outdoor access points equipped with long range antennas allow students to connect to the network even while watching a game. In the tutoring office, instead of using a proctor, MV cameras ensure students are focused on taking their make up tests. In the gaming center, students can be found competing in games like League of Legends, which take a powerful network to support such a high-bandwidth activity. Not only does the MX450 security appliance support the gaming center, it supports the entire campus, and yet students have no problems with latency. For students conducting research at an arboretum off-campus, they can easily access the school network via an outdoor access point deployed in the trees.\nThe seamless connections students experience at Illinois College would not be possible without the ease of network management through the Meraki dashboard. By managing their access points, switches, security appliances, endpoint management, and security cameras all from the same place, the team has time to control more aspects of their network and shift focus to more impactful projects.\nMeraki has impacted our whole department; our ability to operate efficiently, and given us valuable time back to provide solutions and support for our students, faculty and staff.\nCIO\nWhile the breadth of programs and support that the IT team already provides to students and staff is impressive, the school is always looking for new ways to expand their network. Their next major deployment is the large gymnasium, which seats over 2,500 people. The team is also exploring the use of Bluetooth beacons, which are integrated into every Meraki access point. With this technology, the IT team could send push-notifications to students to notify them of upcoming events, discounts, or technology instruction based on their location. Illinois College will continue to be on the forefront of innovating campus experiences as new technologies emerge."

    "text": "The Excelsior Palace Hotel is a 5-star luxury hotel on the Portofino coast of Italy. With its expansive views of the Italian Riviera, fine dining, and wellness treatments, the hotel attracts guests seeking the finest holiday experience. Additionally, it hosts business visitors attending conferences hosted at the hotel event facilities.\nTo meet the high expectations of the hotel\u2019s visitors, Aldo Werdin, Managing Director and General Manager, knew he needed to offer the best Wi-Fi possible. The hotel\u2019s previous network solution was slow and had unreliable coverage. To make matters worse, it was nearly impossible for staff to establish the source of any problems on the network. When it became clear the existing infrastructure was not satisfactory, Werdin decided to deploy an entirely new solution.\nTo this end, Werdin chose Cisco Meraki cloud-managed IT solutions to power the entire property, which dates to 1901 and additionally includes cabanas, a beach club, multiple outdoor pools, a restaurant, and spa.\nWerdin worked with his technology partner to evaluate various solutions. He requested a solution that would be simple to implement (as the hotel does not have an IT team on site), yet powerful enough to service the needs of the hotel. As it happened, the owner/manager of a nearby hotel first told Werdin about Meraki. Werdin was intrigued by the benefits of cloud-managed IT, particularly the simplified management and deployment.\nHe gave Meraki a try, and experienced for himself the ease of the Meraki dashboard. The \u201cextraordinary simplicity of control and management\u201d made a big impression on Werdin.\nBut what really won him over was the range of services included with Meraki, including 24/7 technical support, robust product warranties, and automatic upgrades. These features, included with all Meraki licensing, made Werdin\u2019s life much easier.\nThe Excelsior Palace has a full-stack Meraki solution, including access points, switches, and security appliances. Over a three week period, the hotel deployed a variety of models, throughout the property to provide the best coverage for each area. \u201cThe deployment was clean, fast, and transparent,\u201d Werdin said.\n\u201cCombining all Meraki products not only allows for a unique visibility into our networks, but also makes it much simpler to customise settings for our needs,\u201d Werdin said.\nThe network deployment has high-performance MR42s for various conference rooms and reception lounge; ruggedised MR72s for the outdoor terraces, swimming pools and the entire beach area; and MR33s for guest rooms and hallways.\nAccess points support Layer 3 roaming, allowing users to pass from one AP to another without loss of signal. Access-list rules on the firewall keep staff traffic, both wired and Wi-Fi, separate from that of guests. Visitors access the Internet via a dedicated guest SSID, which is password protected and accessible from anywhere on the property. Using the Dashboard, staff can generate up to 15 SSIDs to dedicate custom access to conference rooms and conference visitors. Finally, across all APs, bandwidth and content control, configured in a few mouse clicks, keep the network safe and speedy.\n\u201cThe Dashboard has helped my employees a lot,\u201d Werdin said. \u201cWe can create custom SSIDs for the conferencing company; change the password for the guest SSID; and run marketing analyses to verify the use of Wi-Fi, attendance, and the most popular areas of the property.\u201d\nFiber optic 100Mb Internet connectivity is connected to MX84 firewalls in High Availability (HA) mode. Meraki MS switches are connected to the redundant security appliance configuration, from which copper cables go out to various offices inside and outside the main hotel building. The firewall has been customized for the hotel\u2019s needs and provides granular visibility and control, powerful antivirus features, and bandwidth tuning based on applications and protocols. The property has also deployed MX security appliances.\nNow, not only is it easier for Werdin to address any issues that arise\u2014it\u2019s also possible to prevent such issues.\n\u201cWe are absolutely happy with Meraki,\u201d Werdin said, \u201cas are our customers.\u201d"

    "text": "\u201cVorsprung durch Technik\u201d (Progress through Technology) is the international Audi slogan and a promise that is not only reflected in its premium cars, but also in its mission, which is to focus on digitisation, sustainability, and urbanisation. Audi\u2019s car dealers also prioritise innovation and a unique and future-oriented customer experience. More and more customers ask for customised cars which cannot all be displayed in the shops, making virtual configuration systems and digital media play an important role in the modern customer journey.\nTo facilitate this virtualisation, Audi provides 800 digital elements, like iPads, to over 2,000 Audi car dealers from Los Angeles to Berlin to Singapore. Hence, it\u2019s crucial for Audi to be able to create and maintain a solid network solution that provides all sites with secure, reliable Wi-Fi.\nThomas Bayerl is in charge of the Digital Business Infrastructure and Processes at Audi and decided that Meraki would be the best choice for Audi\u2019s global Wi-Fi network infrastructure. Read on to find out how Audi manages a network of access points, switches, and security appliances with Meraki across the globe.\n\nIn 2011, Audi opened its first Audi Cities. Audi City showrooms have been 100% digitalised to offer customers the best possible experience with the help of \u201cdigital elements\u201d: Audi City uses \u201cpower walls\u201d to simulate the driving experience in the driver\u2019s seat. With the help of touch screens or iPads, customers can browse through the whole Audi portfolio, and build and configure a 1:1 scale vehicle according to their own individual needs and wants. The performance of those digital devices depends on a stable WiFi network.\n\n\nAll hardware that Audi is planning to use in shops is tested, qualified, and certified in an in-house laboratory, making sure that new solutions are thoroughly tested before going live. When Audi looked into a new networking products, it was the Cisco Account Manager that Thomas Bayerl was in touch with who suggested trying the Meraki cloud-managed solutions, so Bayerl ordered free trial hardware. Hence, Bayerl tested Meraki devices in Audi\u2019s lab and was convinced of the solution. Since then, every new Meraki product gets tested in the lab and in 100% of all scenarios, the products get ordered for the shops.\nAll Cisco Meraki products that we used so far just work. You configure everything and they run very well.\nAudi Ag\nAccording to Bayerl, it needs to be stressed that the cooperation between Audi and Meraki is extremely positive. Audi has a personal point of contact from Meraki Sales and Engineering that work closely with Audi and provide them with new trial devices when needed:\nI like that Meraki is so solution oriented and that our cooperation works absolutely uncomplicated.\nAudi Ag\nGetting Meraki components up and running is straightforward, easy and fast. Once a device is connected to the internet, it automatically pulls the configuration settings and it takes about 10 minutes and it\u2019s working.\nAudi Ag\n\nAudi is very happy with Meraki products and the IT team is pleased with the relationship they built with Meraki. With the Dashboard, the Audi IT team is able to supervise and control worldwide sites all from one location, their headquarters in Germany. Sometimes when there is a failure of one of their digital modules at a remote shop location, the digital retail team first checks the Dashboard to see if it\u2019s a network issue. Most of the time, once the network is up and running, there are no problems with it and the cause for a failure comes from a different source. Even then, the dashboard often turns out to be very helpful in troubleshooting and identifying issues.\nWhenever there is an IT problem, we first check the network and it has never disappointed us.\nAudi Ag\nAudi found a strong IT partner in Cisco Meraki, that enabled them to provide all shops with reliable WiFi and a secure network structure worldwide, in an easy and uncomplicated way."

    "text": "Small class sizes, talented professors, and world-class facilities are cornerstones at Community College of Denver (CCD). CCD provides an exceptional and affordable two-year education to approximately 8,000 students across three campuses. In order to support these students, as well as 1,200 faculty and staff, a two-person IT team manages the network, security, administration, telephony, and servers for the campus.\nWith no one on the team dedicated solely to the network and network infrastructure that was 13 years old, Chris Arcarese, Director of IT, realized it was time to replace their existing network. Not only was the previous solution difficult to configure and manage, but the team often received reports about spotty wireless. They also had little visibility into network issues, making it challenging to monitor and troubleshoot.\nArcarese sought to implement a comprehensive network solution with more visibility and that a small staff could easily manage across multiple sites. He had previously used Cisco Meraki and knew that it would be a great fit for CCD because of the web-based Meraki dashboard and live troubleshooting tools, which make solving issues remotely simple. Additionally, the enhanced visibility provided in the dashboard ensures the IT team is able to improve response times to issues and significantly reduce network downtime.\nI like the ability to quickly track issues in the dashboard. If somebody is reporting that they can\u2019t get on the wireless, it\u2019s really easy to track through our network to see where the problem might exist.\n\nDirector of IT\nArcarese and his team decided to deploy Meraki MR access points, MS switches, and MX security appliances across two of CCD\u2019s campuses. The roll out went quickly, as they deployed 120 APs in two buildings and 115 switches in 15 buildings in only two months.\nThe access points are installed in classrooms, so students have constant wireless access while in class. The team uses Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) for students, staff, and guests to securely authenticate. With just one SSID, ISE can determine if the user is a student or a staff member, and whether they have a school-owned computer or personal device. Based on this, the user is routed to the appropriate network. This makes connecting to the right network seamless for the end-user. Open tickets about the wireless performance have decreased by more than 90% since switching to Meraki, allowing the team to focus on proactive network maintenance. Moreover, the IT team can quickly find network issues in the dashboard when they occur. The network plan solidifies network security as the IT team has firewall rules in place to block access to peer-to-peer websites and unwanted protocols like BitTorrent.\nAcarese and his team were able to easily configure and install the switches across 15 buildings. The team configured the switches and set up trunked ports in just a few clicks. The team can quickly look at the traffic and settings on each switch, making troubleshooting and management much easier than before. Arcarese stated, \u201cWe can tweak settings on a macro level, instead of having to make changes one by one to every switch.\u201d The team now schedules automatic firmware upgrades during off hours, making it seamless for both users and technicians.\nUpdating our switches was time consuming and tedious before, but now we\u2019re able to roll out upgrades automatically.\n\nDirector of IT\n\n\u00a0\nTroubleshooting tools in the dashboard have saved the team hours of investigating network issues. Using the packet capture tool, Arcarese can easily isolate and diagnose network problems. For example, by running a packet capture on the port a printer was connected to, Arcarese quickly confirmed that it was a printer issue and not a network issue. Arcarese added, \u201cWe can now monitor the network in a cohesive way, whereas in the past, we might have had to use additional software or monitoring devices.\u201d\nArcarese and his team deployed two MX security appliances for even more network visibility. The team configured several isolated networks for added security. Specific devices like their HVAC system, gas line monitoring systems, and credit card machines are on protected networks to prevent hackers from accessing the devices. The team also has VoIP traffic prioritized to ensure staff members have appropriate bandwidth.\nWhile there are countless features in the dashboard that the team takes advantage of, scheduled summary reports are key for Arcarese and his team. With the summary reports Arcarese has automatically scheduled, the team gets emails about network traffic, bandwidth utilization, and security threats. If something looks wrong in the weekly report, like a spike in bandwidth usage, the team can look in the dashboard and quickly find the discrepancy.\nIn the future, Arcarese plans to deploy Meraki switches and APs to the third CCD campus. For now, Arcarese and his team are thrilled with how easy it is to monitor the network and provide robust and secure wireless for students while on campus. As Arcarese said, \u201cBeing able to manage everything in one dashboard is something I haven\u2019t been able to do in my 20 years in IT.\u201d"

    "text": "With over 1,400 access points providing district-wide wireless coverage, security appliances aggregating six gigabits of traffic, switches making network troubleshooting a breeze, mobile-device management securing 300 school iPads, and security cameras allowing for simplified video management, Reading School District\u2019s full-stack Meraki solution provides an amazing network experience for students, teachers, and the IT team.\nReading School District, located in southeastern Pennsylvania, is the fourth largest school district in the state with 13 elementary schools, four middle schools, one intermediate high school, and one senior high school, with additional special use schools and administrative locations, totaling 25 buildings. The district is committed to providing reliable wireless coverage, secure network access, and physical safety for students and teachers with the classroom engagement and technology resources they deserve.\nAs the only Network and Systems Administrator, CR Hiestand knew he needed a solution that was easy to manage in order to meet the district\u2019s expectations and provide the best experience for users. So, when using a different vendor for wireless, switching, and security \u2013 with no centralized management, leading to difficult and duplicate on-site configurations \u2013 became too much to handle, CR decided to look for a solution that was easier to manage, without compromising performance.\n\nTo decide on the right solution, CR conducted a trial with two different networking vendors at the high school. The results were extremely clear: one solution was frustrating to manage, while the Meraki solution was easy and straightforward. Because of this, CR decided to deploy Meraki access points, switches, security appliances, mobile device management software, and security cameras across the district.\n\nWith Meraki access points and switches, learning happens in the classroom without a hitch. In two summers, CR completely ripped out his legacy wireless solution and replaced it with Meraki MR42 access points at all 19 schools, allowing students and teachers network access whenever they need it.\nTo access the network, the district uses three SSIDs: one for district-owned devices, with students and teachers authenticating via 802.1X and separated by group policies for appropriate web filtering, a guest network that securely connects visitors using a generated username and password, and a third network using Systems Manager Sentry for mobile devices enrolled in Systems Manager. This allows the school to throttle student and guest traffic and separate them into different VLANs automatically. In addition, the ease of configuration and management with Meraki access points has been a game changer for CR. Before, he would have to make individual changes to access points in each building, leaving room for error. Now, with the Meraki dashboard, he has one pre-configured template across all 1,400 access points, allowing him to make changes once and deploy them instantly.\nI used to have to make a change 20 times, which took forever and opened up a lot of room for mistakes. It makes a huge difference for me to be able to make a change in one spot and have it take effect for all the buildings.\nNetwork and Systems Administrator\nSupporting these access points, and the rest of the network, are Meraki switches. CR has deployed switches at three schools, with MS225s at the edge, MS350s stacked at the core in the two smaller schools, and MS425s at the core of the larger building. The switches are so easy to configure and manage through the Meraki dashboard that CR was even able to train non-technical IT staff to correctly configure ports on the switches, greatly simplifying administrative overhead. Plus, built-in troubleshooting tools, like packet captures, have allowed for easy troubleshooting of network problems. CR used to manually draw out his network diagram in confusing software, but the network topology in the Meraki dashboard automatically updates and saves hours of effort.\nI had to troubleshoot an MV camera in a building that does not have a Meraki switch. So, I put in a spare Meraki switch just so I could use the packet capture \u2014 that feature is really nice.\nNetwork and Systems Administrator\n\nTo keep student data private and the network secure, Reading has all district traffic flow through two Meraki MX450 security appliances; six gigabits of total bandwidth across all of their buildings. They aggregate all of the district\u2019s Internet capacity through the MX450s, along with a vMX100 in Azure, and a MX64 in one building using site-to-site VPN to connect back to the network. CR added, \u201cSite-to-site VPN is probably my favorite MX feature by far because it\u2019s so incredibly simple.\u201d He also deployed AMP for malware protection, which has needed no additional management since being set-up.\nWith a traditional analog-based security camera system, Reading struggled to capture quality video footage and use it effectively. Each DVR could only support 20 cameras, and when one camera went down the entire DVR went down, leading to gaps in coverage. When CR learned that Meraki MV security cameras were managed through the same, intuitive dashboard where he managed the rest of his network, and that all video footage was stored on the camera instead of in a NVR or DVR, he was sold.\nThe district started by deploying MV at two administrative buildings and one elementary school, and are already seeing the benefits. With no DVRs, CR and the security team have saved significant time by not having to maintain outdated systems or continuously replace them. By managing the cameras through the dashboard, anyone with the correct permissions and an Internet connection has access. This allows security guards, and even principals and administrators, to view footage from their phones, without having to go to the video monitoring room. The video quality is a vast improvement from their old system as well; the team can now quickly identify the who, what, when, and where of any situation. Plus, with the Motion Search tool, security guards can isolate an incident and find what they are looking for in less than 20 minutes, rather than searching through hours of video footage. The team plans to deploy thousands of MV security cameras district-wide, with cameras at every school in the next couple of years.\nWe now have significantly better video quality and much better coverage. We are moving from something where we could say, \u2018Yes there are people moving in that area doing something\u2019 to saying, \u2018I know exactly who that student is and I know exactly what they are doing.\u2019 That is huge.\nNetwork and Systems Administrator\n\nAs the number of district-owned devices continued to grow, CR needed a solution that would allow him to manage these devices painlessly. With 300 shared iPads at the elementary and special education schools, he wanted a solution to control the applications that were available and make sure all of the devices were accounted for. With Meraki Systems Manager, CR can push out applications to all devices remotely, and keep track of which students are using what devices. When a teacher wants to make a change to the application list, they can just submit a ticket and the IT team can quickly make the update.\nEven with the powerful network and management tools that CR has at his disposal with Meraki Systems Manager and the Meraki dashboard, he wanted to truly optimize the end-user experience and quickly isolate issues that may not have to do with the network. With Meraki Insight, CR has end-to-end visibility, and can easily identify network problems from the end-point to the application server, in a fraction of the time it used to take to troubleshoot. With a holistic view of what is contributing to the end-user\u2019s network slow-down, whether it\u2019s the iPad, web application, or the network, CR can find a faster resolution for students and teachers.\n\nAs Meraki continues to add more features in the dashboard, release new products, and develop new insights for users, CR is always on the lookout for compelling ways to leverage the latest technology. Given the superior management capabilities and time savings his Meraki full-stack solution provides, CR can dedicate more of his time to taking on new IT initiatives and improving technology in the classroom district-wide, rather than troubleshooting or configuring the network. CR concluded, \u201cThanks to the vastly superior management capabilities and the minimal amount of time spent managing, troubleshooting, or configuring Meraki hardware, we have more time that we can dedicate to making our classrooms 21st-century learning centers.\u201d"

    "text": "With 208,000 students in more than 200 schools, Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) in central Florida is the 9th largest school district in the country. The district\u2019s size has not stopped it from leading the way for schools across the nation in implementing a 1:1 program. The goal: to turn every school into a digital-curriculum school, equipping students from kindergarten to high school with their own school-issued laptops. Physical textbooks, lockers, and paper tests will be a thing of the past, as students move toward only participating in content that is delivered online. But before this 1:1 model can be implemented, the district needs a robust and secure network that give students and teachers continuous access to the Internet for learning to take place.\nWhen David Overton, Senior Director of Information Security, joined OCPS a couple years ago, he found a reactive and time-strapped team of network engineers and operators. Not only did the inconvenience of traveling to each school to solve network issues bring down the team, but the time lost took away from their other important projects. Even though there are technical support reps (TSR) stationed at each school, they don\u2019t have the expertise needed to configure a switch or set up a router when the network goes down. Overton added, \u201cWith the legacy infrastructure, we had to put a lot more boots on the ground. We had to get the engineers out to each individual school, and that was a logistical nightmare.\u201d\nTo combat this, Overton needed a solution that would remove the need for on-site management, so his engineers could focus on implementing a successful 1:1 program across the district.\nThe search for a solution that would provide centralized, remote management commenced. Only one vendor offered remote management capabilities as well as the robust technology required to support a 1:1 program: Cisco Meraki. To accommodate the increase in devices, the district needed more access points, which in turn called for better, faster, and stronger switches. Therefore, the team decided to deploy Meraki MR access points and MS switches district-wide. With new schools coming online every week, the district is on pace to deploy 100% Meraki networks at all of the schools in the district in less than two years.\nWith the help of Meraki reps and a third-party technology vendor, the deployment team can easily flip an entire school in four hours. Starting at one o\u2019clock, the team walks the school to make sure the deployment design is ready to go. At 3:30 p.m., they start hanging up the access points, about one access point per classroom, with multiple in larger classrooms, gyms, and common areas. When the final bell rings at 4:30, and the remaining students head home for the day, the team begins unracking and uninstalling the legacy equipment, and installing the new Meraki gear. They then test the network, making sure everything is working properly, and that the intrusion detection system and security cameras are online. A couple of weeks after installation, the team then looks at the location heat map feature in the Meraki dashboard to double-check that there is complete coverage, and they continue to use the tool to optimize layouts as needed. The team also receives weekly summary reports to make sure no access points are overloaded. The ease of installation and deployment is putting OCPS ahead of schedule to turn traditional schools into digital-curriculum schools.\nThey completed a school on Friday in four hours. Switches, routers, and access points. Completely transitioned.\nSenior Director of Information Security\n\u00a0\nOCPS is standardizing their SSID availability across the district down to three: one for administration, students, and guests. Each SSID has its own rules set up to make sure that teachers and students have access to the resources they need. With every student averaging three devices, the team works to ensure there is enough bandwidth across the district. Through the Meraki dashboard, the team can easily identify anomalous traffic or throttle back bandwidth when needed. For example, when the students are participating in state-mandated testing, the team can make sure that the testing application has as much bandwidth as it needs to run correctly.\nWith the first wave of OCPS schools now transitioned over to Meraki, the centralized, remote management has saved the team countless hours of driving between schools and manual troubleshooting. Before, the network engineers would have to go to each school, find the problem switch or access point, and manually troubleshoot. And with 200 schools, this was not efficient, and sometimes not feasible, leaving long gaps in coverage. Now, the team can just log into the dashboard from their office, and easily see what the problem is.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough good stuff about the dashboard,\u201d Overton said. \u201cIt gives me an idea of what is going on; if there is an issue at the school, the network folks are able to get in there and pinpoint the issue much faster than if they had to go out to each switch and troubleshoot.\u201d If they do need to change something on the equipment, a TSR can plug in or reseed a cable, without an engineer needing to go onsite. Thanks to this improved resource utilization, the engineering team can spend their time looking for anomalies in the network environment, being proactive, and focusing on a network redesign project.\nThere is a big difference in the maintenance and upkeep. For the schools that are not transitioned, we have to go there and spend hours trying to troubleshoot. Whereas with Meraki, we just go in and look at the dashboard and it tells you what\u2019s going on.\nSenior Director of Information Security\nThe digital-curriculum schools provide significant advantages for students and teachers. With every student having their own laptop, teachers can use new and creative applications to provide a more personalized learning experience. From YouTube to Khan Academy, students can digest information in different ways, leading to more effective lessons and a better learning experience. Students no longer need to lug textbooks back and forth between home and school, and time spent at their lockers is quickly dwindling, since everything they need is electronic. OCPS is setting the example for school districts across the nation, with a model in place that will enable every student to succeed in a digital economy."

    "text": "With an aging network due for a refresh, the IT team at Pfeiffer University, a private liberal arts college in North Carolina with around 2,000 students, knew they needed a leader to spearhead a network upgrade. In the fall of 2016, Dr. Ken Russell joined Pfeiffer University to lead a six-person Digital Transformation and Technology (DTT) team. As VP of Digital Transformation and CIO, Dr. Russell\u2019s main priority was to revamp and expand the technological landscape across Pfeiffer\u2019s five locations. One of the first projects the DTT team worked on involved tackling the aging network, which had no centralized management capabilities and provided little visibility into network analytics. Dr. Russell explained, \u201cWhat I wanted to do was not just fix the network at Pfeiffer, but position Pfeiffer for the 21st century in a way that showed folks that even a small university can have a big impact with the right environment.\u201d\nWhen it came time to investigate a new networking solution, Cisco Meraki was already at the top of Dr. Russell\u2019s mind, even more so after attending a Meraki webinar. The advanced and reliable technology, robust troubleshooting capabilities, and easy-to-use dashboard helped set Meraki apart. \u201cWe wanted something that was built for the future. Something we could easily implement and maintain. The fact that the Meraki dashboard can tell us where things are going great and where things might have some trouble was perfect,\u201d Dr. Russell shared.\nThanks to the opening of a new Charlotte, North Carolina campus, the DTT team had the chance to build a new network from the ground up. With the need to create a network that could support and enable new projects, like IPTV, in mind, the team first purchased Meraki MS switches and later deployed MR access points and MX security appliances. Dr. Russell shared, \u201cAt the Charlotte site, our Meraki switches and firewalls are on display for all to see in a custom designed, glass-walled data room. I did that so people would know this was a showcase, our commitment to digital transformation. We\u2019re not hiding IT in a closet anymore.\u201d\nWhat I wanted to do was not just fix the network at Pfeiffer, but position Pfeiffer for the 21st century in a way that showed folks that even a small university can have a big impact with the right environment.\nVP of Digital Transformation and CIO\nA variety of multigigabit Meraki access and distribution switches are deployed at the Charlotte campus, including the MS220, MS320, MS350, and MS425s. With more than 1 Gig throughput on each switch port, Pfeiffer is able to future proof their network to support high-bandwidth learning applications. Some of the switches are hardlined for TVs, printers, and Cisco Spark phones, and all of the switches are currently stacked. The ability to segregate traffic via the switches has been instrumental for the marriage and family therapy clinic, which requires this segregation in order to ensure accreditation. Alex Freeman, Operations Network Analyst for the DTT team explained the deep visibility the switches provide, saying, \u201cI can see which stack the switch is part of the client usage, what ports are PoE\u2026 I can click into the client and see what port they\u2019re connected to\u2026 So much simpler and everything is readily available. It\u2019s much easier than entering command after command after command.\u201d\nHigh-density Wave 2 802.11ac MR53 access points deployed across the Charlotte campus provide students and faculty with a multigigabit experience to seamlessly support access to online learning resources. Students authenticate into the network using a preshared key, while faculty and staff authenticate via 802.1X. Layer 7 firewall capabilities on the access points also keep students off of P2P sites while the Air Marshal feature keeps rogue SSIDs off the network. Network usage statistics, traffic analytics, and heatmaps are all available in the dashboard, providing the DTT team with valuable student and client data.\nFrom a security perspective, the Pfeiffer team relies on six MX security appliances, with two MX400s deployed at the Charlotte campus, two MX600s at the Misenheimer, NC campus, and 2 MX100s at the Raleigh, NC campus. Along with firewall rules on the access points, the security appliances are configured with traffic shaping and content filtering for P2P and websites associated with malware. Not only has it been easier to configure and manage VLANs, but the team has been able to prioritize VoIP and traffic from their learning management system (LMS) seamlessly on the network as well, ensuring constant uptime for students. One of the team\u2019s favorite features is the site-to-site VPN, which they were able to configure with just a few clicks.\nUsing the remote troubleshooting and management features have been extremely simple for all Meraki product lines and have provided a \u201creliable environment for faculty, staff, and students,\u201d according to Dr. Russell. Scott Perry, Operations Manager for the Office of Digital Transformation and Technology, shared that the team is \u201cthankful to have Meraki. We\u2019re able to log into the dashboard and see everything in one spot. You can make changes on the fly, whereas with our old technology we had no centralized management and had to SSH into each product, one at a time.\u201d\nFuture plans for the Pfeiffer University team focus heavily on expanding their wireless reach. They hope to accomplish this by replacing old access points with new Meraki APs at the Misenheimer campus, configuring an additional SSID for guest access, and potentially deploying APs in dorms and outdoor areas. The DTT team loves their Meraki deployment, with Dr. Russell concluding, \u201cWe have a really great, robust network and it\u2019s exactly what we needed.\u201d"

    "text": "Imagine a scenario where students can easily log onto a school-issued iPad, find the appropriate application, and start their digital lesson, with no iPad lockouts, no access to distracting websites, and no instruction time wasted.\nWith patience, will-power, and tenacity, the team at Moreland School District was able to make this scenario a reality for their students. Over 4,800 students attend one of four elementary schools, two K-8 schools, and one middle school located in Santa Clara County, CA. As part of the district\u2019s digital learning initiative, students from TK-kindergarten to second grade have access to school-owned iPads, while students from third to eighth grade use school-owned Chromebooks.\nWith Meraki Systems Manager deployed district-wide, students can focus on learning and teachers can focus on implementing new curriculum, with continuous access to wireless connections and pre-configured devices. But it wasn\u2019t always a harmonious experience; there was a time when the district\u2019s iPad deployment was in disarray, which caused headaches for the IT team and interrupted instruction for both students and teachers.\nWhen Denis Guerrero joined Moreland School District (MSD) as Director of Technology, Dr. Mary Kay Going, the Superintendent, tasked him with finding a new way to manage their 1,300 district-wide iPads. Thinking this wouldn\u2019t be too challenging of a task, he started looking into their current management process. To his dismay, he found a never-ending list of complications, challenging management practices, and unusable devices, spiraling into an iPad nightmare that he wasn\u2019t sure how to handle.\nThere were 85 different Apple ID accounts associated with the district. Some were personal accounts, others district issued, leading to hundreds of locked iPads from lost passwords and unknown security question answers. On top of their day job, one teacher per school site was deemed the technology teacher, and given the responsibility of managing the iPads with Apple Configurator and purchasing apps with a variety of personal credit cards, gift cards, and vouchers. Not only did this decentralized process cause confusion for many schools, but there was no way to track what apps different schools were using, leading to duplicated efforts. Plus, different groups of students needed different apps for instruction, but there was no way to classify these groups and push out the appropriate apps.\nDenis knew the district needed a solution that would streamline all of their Apple accounts into one, allow for zero-touch provisioning, and give them the ability to create different student profiles for easy app management. He researched several different endpoint management solutions, and because the district was already using Meraki wireless, being able to manage the iPads in the same cloud-based dashboard as their access points solidified his decision. The District decided to deploy Meraki Systems Manager to manage all of their iPads district-wide.\nAfter working to consolidate the 85 Apple accounts into one, enrolling all of their iPads onto the correct Device Enrollment Program (DEP) account, consolidating all of their gift cards and purchased app licenses, and registering all of their iPads with Apple School Manager, the district was finally ready to roll out Systems Manager.\nTo properly support all students and provide differentiated instruction, different profiles needed to be set up for general education, special education, and English Learners. Through the Meraki dashboard, Denis created new classroom profiles based on discussions with various departments and teacher feedback to insure the appropriate apps for each profile. After creating the first profile, he simply copied it, deleted the apps he didn\u2019t need and added new apps, made other minor adjustments, and saved the new profile. This saved the technology department from having to start from scratch every time, so they could roll out the iPads faster and with more accuracy. The new iPad profiles provide a much more personalized learning experience for students, with the ability to truly control what apps certain groups of students can access.\nKeeping apps up-to-date is also a huge advantage of Systems Manager. Denis explained, \u201cOne of the benefits of Systems Manager is the ability and ease of updating apps. The Meraki dashboard makes it a breeze.\u201d This ensures there is no interruption in student learning and that students have the latest and greatest apps every time they use them.\nTo ensure that all of the school\u2019s iPads remain onsite, the technology department set up geofencing rules to alert them if an iPad leaves its assigned school. A teacher accidentally took her classroom\u2019s iPads to another school location, and the Technology Department was immediately notified that the iPads had left their intended area. Denis added, \u201cThat was a huge eye opener for us, how quickly we could identify what was going on with the iPads and track them down.\u201d\nWith Systems Manager, MSD finally has a centralized process for requesting and pushing out new apps. To request a new app, teachers just fill out a Google form with the requested app, their school, and classroom type. Ed Services then reviews and approves the request and the IT team deploys the app to the appropriate profile. This has eliminated the need for the technology teacher to control apps for the school site, freeing up their time to help teachers learn new technology systems and integrate new apps into their curriculum.\nWe now centrally control the process for requesting apps. We have a form that teachers can fill out to request different apps. Then, Ed Services reviews, sends us the approval, and we move forward with deploying the apps to the specific profile. Normally, it takes a max of 5 minutes.\nDirector of Technology, Moreland School District\n\n\u00a0\nAlthough Systems Manager works well as a standalone product, there are compelling integrations with other Meraki solutions. With one Meraki access point per classroom district-wide, the technology department realized several synergies between their wireless and endpoint management solutions. When there is a problem, technology department personnel can very easily troubleshoot to see if there is a network issue, iPad issue, or Apple issue. Denis explained, \u201cWe had a situation where apps weren\u2019t getting pushed out. So we took a deeper look, drilled down from the access point to the iPad, and it turned out it wasn\u2019t an issue with the network, but a communication issue with Apple\u2019s servers. So, instead of spinning our wheels trying to figure out if it was a network issue or the iPads, we could quickly pinpoint that there was a communication issue with Apple.\u201d\nFor me, the interoperability is key. We knew the MDM would work seamlessly with the wireless APs and give us a level of detail we wouldn\u2019t get if we had separate systems.\nDirector of Technology, Moreland School District\nWith a streamlined iPad management solution and app requesting processes in place, teachers and students are experiencing vast improvements in the time dedicated to learning. There are now more apps available to students, with customizable views based on grade level and learning group. Teachers now have more time to focus on instruction, rather than on password resets a lack of access to the right curriculum.\nTo continue down their path to improve student learning, MSD plans replace 800 old iPad 2s with new iPad 5s. This would have been impossible previously, but with Systems Manager, the IT team can assign the new device serial number to the appropriate school and profile, connect the device to the Internet, and simply watch as apps, Wi-Fi settings, and profiles are automatically installed. Denis concluded, \u201cAnything that deals with an iPad is now much more manageable than it was before. There is no longer the nightmare of many Apple IDs and password management; Systems Manager has streamlined so many processes for us, from how teachers request apps, to how they get deployed on a device. It has been automated to the greatest extent possible.\u201d"

    "text": "Founded in 1981, Kiddie Academy\u00ae provides educational child care across the US. Since its founding, Kiddie Academy has grown to over 200 franchised academies in 26 states and the District of Columbia. Today, the company is ranked among the top 25 percent of Fortune\u2019s Franchise 500 companies and was recently listed as the fastest growing childhood learning franchise by Franchise Times.\nCTO Greg Goodwin, VP of Technology Ben Lieb, and Cloud Services Manager Jack Senatore are responsible for the strategic, operational, and executional expansion of Kiddie Academy\u2019s technical programs, and they establish best-of-breed technology solutions for Kiddie Academy.\nTo ensure Kiddie Academy\u2019s networks and data are properly protected, Greg, Ben, and Jack sought to develop a robust IT infrastructure solution that could expand with the rapid growth of their system. The IT team\u2019s top priority was to implement a solution that could protect academy networks and data from outside threats and control the web content that students viewed on academy classroom technology. Additionally, each academy needed robust wireless coverage, covering all classrooms within an academy as well as outdoor play areas. \u201cWe needed an enterprise-level system \u2014 one that was robust and that we could have confidence in,\u201d Greg said.\nPrior to implementing Meraki, there were several problems with existing academy networks: differing equipment implemented across the system, spotty wireless coverage, and inconsistent network security protection. To solve these issues, the IT team evaluated numerous network equipment vendors to identify a better solution. The team recognized that most options either provided content filtering or firewall capabilities, but only Meraki offered a complete, all-in-one solution. \u201cWe were looking for a complete solution, but we weren\u2019t able to find another solution that could put the full package together like Meraki.\u201d said Greg. In addition, the team recognized the need for a solution that was easy for franchisees to implement and manage. \u201cMost of our franchisees do not have a technical background. We needed an enterprise solution for non-technical people.\u201d said Ben.\nThe team identified a Meraki solution that consists of a Meraki MX security appliance and MR access points. A standard Kiddie Academy configuration template was also created by the team allowing all Kiddie Academy locations to use a standard network configuration, and as a result, making setup and troubleshooting easier. \u201cThe ease of implementation and management has been a major improvement for our academies, freeing our franchisees to focus on running their academies rather than managing network equipment\u201d, said Jack.\nKiddie Academy has deployed Meraki hardware in three different ways, depending on what works best for each academy location. At most academies, franchisees work with one of Kiddie Academy\u2019s preferred vendors to install and configure Meraki equipment. At other academies, franchisees use a local IT contractor to install Meraki. And at a handful of academies owned by franchisees with technical backgrounds, franchisees set up the Meraki hardware themselves. Kiddie Academy has had success with all three types of installations because of the ease of installation of the Meraki devices.\nBecause Meraki is cloud managed through the Meraki dashboard, academy networks can be managed from any location. This allows franchisees who own multiple academies to manage academy networks from anywhere. Changing network configuration is also easy. If additional access points need to be added, academy owners just add a license key within the Meraki cloud dashboard and then plug the access point into the network. All configuration is automatically applied by the Meraki system.\nWith content filtering provided by the MX security appliance, children at Kiddie Academy are protected from viewing inappropriate web content on classroom technology. The Meraki dashboard can also be used to easily blacklist unsafe and inappropriate websites.\nWith Meraki, academies have seen increased productivity by teachers and other academy staff. Meraki enables teachers to use wireless tablets from any location in an academy to provide frequent updates to parents about students daily activities. Learning opportunities utilizing technology have also extended beyond the classroom to outside play areas.\nMoving forward, Kiddie Academy sees Meraki as a fantastic solution to protect students from inappropriate web content and to enable improved student learning through reliable network connectivity. In addition, Meraki provides protection against external threats, protecting academy data, systems, and the Kiddie Academy brand."

    "text": "With its large red marquee towering over San Francisco\u2019s historic Castro District, the Castro Theatre has served as a landmark for generations of city dwellers since its construction nearly a century ago. The movie theater has borne witness to seismic changes within the neighborhood and the broader San Francisco area, from the gay rights movement that began in the 1970s to the rise of the tech boom.\nThe theater\u2019s intricate Spanish Baroque architecture has attracted the interest of many people looking for a beautiful space to host events like technology conferences, lecture series, film festivals, comedy shows, and more. In fact, most of the Castro Theatre\u2019s revenue today comes not from the wide variety of movies and stage performances it hosts, but from outside event organizers who rent out the grand facility.\n\nThough the venue\u2019s staff worked hard over the last few decades to upgrade the theater\u2019s projection equipment, sound system, and seating arrangements to keep up with the desires of modern audiences, the Wi-Fi network was largely left neglected since its installation years ago. Richard Hildreth, who has been involved with the theater since 2002, was all too aware of the shortcomings of the theater\u2019s network. That\u2019s because he had set it up.\n\u201cAll we had were two or three consumer-grade, home-style Wi-Fi routers, one on each floor of the theater,\u201d Hildreth explained. \u201cThey weren\u2019t logically connected into a single network; we actually had three separate networks, none of which provided a particularly strong signal.\u201d The unreliability of the network disrupted the theater\u2019s everyday operations. For example, the theater\u2019s box office booth just outside the lobby uses an electronic point-of-sale device to sell tickets, and when the network failed or couldn\u2019t reach the booth, ticket sales would slow to a crawl.\nThe theater\u2019s poor Wi-Fi connectivity wasn\u2019t just a huge headache for staff and visitors. It also threatened the Castro Theatre\u2019s ability to continue attracting event organizers, whose events frequently fill the theater\u2019s capacity of around 1,400 people and require stellar wireless connectivity. For Hildreth and the rest of the thater\u2019s management team, that was the primary driver for starting the search for a new solution. \u201cWe have to constantly make sure we\u2019re keeping up with the times and meeting our clients\u2019 needs,\u201d Hildreth said. \u201cWe could no longer deny that the demand for a more stable and secure Wi-Fi network was there.\u201d\n\nRight around the time that the Castro Theatre team knew a new network was in order, they were approached by Cisco Meraki to test a deployment of some new high-density Meraki MR53E and MR42E indoor access points (APs). These APs are purpose-built to ensure connectivity for high density users in small zones, like event venues. They have 4\u00d74:4 antennas and a spatial stream architecture that, when combined with their ability to automatically connect to new Meraki narrow patch antennas, ensure service for the largest possible number of concurrent clients.\nThe enormous space of the theater\u2019s auditorium, coupled with the need to provide 1,400 people with wireless connectivity at any given time, made the Castro Theatre an ideal setting for Meraki to deploy these new access points. In particular, Hildreth knew that theater-goers would benefit from more targeted coverage, made possible by the narrow patch antennas\u2019 ability to focus coverage toward clusters of mobile device users. He gladly welcomed Meraki into the theater. \u201cMy familiarity with Cisco from way back in the day gave me confidence in Meraki, and I was looking forward to a solution that was much simpler to manage,\u201d he said.\nInstalling the new Meraki equipment took less than three days, a process that Hildreth said went \u201cas smoothly as it could have possibly gone.\u201d In total, 20 APs and antennas were installed throughout the theater; most were in the main auditorium, with others installed behind the movie screen, backstage, in the mezzanine, and in the lobby to ensure wireless coverage regardless of a user\u2019s location. Hildreth was pleased with the speed and ease of installation, explaining that \u201cThe installation process didn\u2019t impact theater operations at all.\u201d\n\nAfter deploying Meraki, there was only one thing to do: put it to the test. In March 2018, Lesbians Who Tech held flagship events for its fifth annual summit at the Castro Theatre, bringing in 5,000 attendees for three days of keynote sessions, networking, and sponsor-attendee meetings.\nLesbians Who Tech (LWT) was founded to bring new opportunities to LGBTQ non-binary and gender non-conforming women and allies, as well as the organizations who would benefit from hiring these smart, talented individuals. According to Lindsey Frischer, Director of Business Development and Growth at LWT, the organization gives members \u201ca stage where they can present their expertise.\u201d\nLWT\u2019s 2018 summit was its most ambitious yet, with more than 170 speaking sessions, dozens of events taking place around the Castro neighborhood, and over 100 partners set up within pavilions to showcase their brands and innovations to attendees. Speakers including Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Uber\u2019s chief brand officer, Bozoma Saint John, inspired and educated audiences. But there was one small problem: the Castro Theatre, where most of the key sessions were held, wasn\u2019t big enough to hold all of the people interested in watching these sessions.\n\u201cAs an organization that preaches the importance of diversity and inclusion, we wanted to make sure the events were available to everyone,\u201d said Michelle Skoor, Managing Director at LWT. \u201cWe knew the Castro Theatre couldn\u2019t accommodate the number of people who wanted to watch the events. That\u2019s why we chose to live stream our keynotes and sessions and encouraged attendees to share their thoughts about the conference through social media. All of that required a rock-solid Wi-Fi network.\u201d\n\nThe newly installed Meraki equipment was up to the task. \u201cPeople were really excited about the Wi-Fi this year,\u201d Frischer, the Director at LWT, said. Thanks to on-stage announcements and signs around the theater promoting the Wi-Fi network, users were able to log right on and start using the network.\nRight before the start of the conference, the LWT team decided to position a huge LED screen right in front of the theater\u2019s movie screen. This had the unfortunate side effect of largely blocking the wireless signal emanating from three key access points located right behind the screen. As a result, only nine APs were available to support the load of around 1,000 audience members at any given time \u2014 about 100 people per AP. Nevertheless, the APs performed with aplomb.\nTwo newly introduced Meraki wireless capabilities ensured peak network performance at the summit. Meraki Wireless Health helped the installation team closely examine users\u2019 experiences on the network and the performance of individual access points. Additionally, the team used RF profiles to configure all of the APs for an auditorium setting. Rx-SOP (Receive Start of Packet) settings, a part of RF profiles, helped mitigate any potential interference stemming from having so many APs located close together.\nIn the end, the network provided attendees with a reliable way to connect and share their experiences with the world around them. And that\u2019s exactly what they did. Over 10,000 tweets were posted using the official #lwtsummit hashtag, garnering 1.2 million impressions. The Lesbians Who Tech Facebook page saw a large increase in followers and post engagement during the conference. And compared to the year prior, the LWT conference app experienced a 35% increase in active users and a 51% increase in bookmarked talks.\nThe Lesbians Who Tech summit was the first event to take advantage of the Castro Theatre\u2019s new Meraki Wi-Fi solution, but there will undoubtedly be many more. Hildreth is thrilled to have a reliable and easily configurable network infrastructure in place. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about serving our clients, though that matters a great deal, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about what the network can do for us as a theater, whether that\u2019s making it easier to sell tickets or using location analytics to better understand how many visitors come to the theater everyday and which events prove to be the most popular ones. Meraki is about so much more than Wi-Fi, and that\u2019s what excites us the most,\u201d Hildreth said."

    "text": "What if you could find out what animals needed attention at the animal shelter, which sporting equipment was used most frequently in the city gym, which parking garage spaces were available most often, and when traffic was the busiest around city hall \u2014 all in a matter of minutes, from anywhere? Although this may sound futuristic, government organizations, like the city of Fayetteville, are already using technology to solve for these questions, and much more. And they\u2019re not using complicated IoT sensors or hundreds of software programs to do so \u2014 just security cameras.\nThe city of Fayetteville is home to 83,000 residents in northwest Arkansas. It is the third largest city in the state, home to the University of Arkansas, and has a lot to offer its residents and visitors, from increasing job opportunities to providing safe and fun community spaces. That\u2019s why Brad Fulmer, Infrastructure Manager at the city of Fayetteville, knew he and his team could do more to benefit the community with improved technology.\n\nSeveral government departments, from City Hall to transportation, wanted security cameras to keep employees and constituents safe. So, they individually deployed security cameras in their respective buildings and areas. Unfortunately for Fulmer and his two-person IT team, the departments all used different security camera vendors. The IT team went from managing no security cameras to managing seven disparate systems, creating headaches for the IT team. Not only were they handed several different systems to manage at once, but the video footage was hard to access and poor quality, making it difficult to find important events. Plus, they had to go on-site to search video footage and troubleshoot problems \u2014 and as all of the security systems worked differently, there was increased complexity and many wasted hours.\nFulmer and his team had finally had enough. They needed one solution to manage the security systems for all of the government offices, while reducing the amount of time spent searching video footage. After conducting a Cisco Meraki MV trial, the team immediately saw how easy security camera deployment and management could be. They began completely overhauling their entire camera solution, knocking off cameras one by one until the City Hall, District Courts, Prosecutor\u2019s Office, City Gym, Recycling and Trash center, Transportation Offices, and Animal Shelter were using the same security camera solution: Meraki MV.\nWhen we got the trial, we fired up a couple cameras and had them going within minutes. It was just that simple.\nInfrastructure Manager, City of Fayetteville\nThe ability to manage all of their indoor and outdoor security cameras with a single solution was just the beginning. After deploying 61 MV cameras across the city, the IT team realized several benefits that they were able to take advantage of immediately.\nCompared to their previous solution, the MV security cameras were much easier to use. In the past, when the IT team received a request to pull footage, they would spend hours trying to find the desired clip. But with Meraki, it only takes a couple of minutes. Even better, the IT team has almost completely off-loaded the security camera requests that come in. Instead, when they configure the cameras in the Meraki dashboard, they tag them to the appropriate network (separated by government building) and give access to particular users in each department to see those cameras. This gives non-IT users the ability to view, search, and export video footage on their own \u2014 eliminating the need to involve the IT team in searching footage altogether. For example, at the animal shelter, workers regularly use the cameras to check on the animals in the back and search past footage to find incidents, without having to bother IT.\nWe now give access rights to non-IT users and they search their own video footage. It took us out of the equation for the most part.\nInfrastructure Manager, City of Fayetteville\nThe IT team and on-site users mainly take advantage of two key MV features in the Meraki dashboard. The Motion Search feature allows the user to select a region of interest in a video, and only see motion events from those search parameters. This allows users to find relevant footage in seconds, rather than spending hours going through all of the footage. In addition to Motion Search, the team also leverages the heat map tool. The heat map functionality shows seven days worth of motion data on a per-day or per-hour basis, allowing the IT team to look at an aggregated amount of data at once to make informed business decisions.\nThe team uses these features in a variety of ways. Using their outdoor cameras, they can easily see who delivered packages, and identify the offenders when a package is damaged. In the city gym, the team uses heat maps to see what sporting equipment is being used most frequently, allowing them to plan more accordingly and replace equipment when it is worn out.\nWe use the heat maps to see what equipment is being used most often in the city gym. We can see which equipment is the most popular, and it helps the committee decide which equipment they need to replace more often.\nInfrastructure Manager, City of Fayetteville\nSometimes, they even use the cameras to solve minor problems. Some employees tracked a lot of mud into the building, and the facilities team used Motion Search to identify the culprits in minutes. Fulmer added, \u201cWe use to get requests to search for something small before, and would have to say no, we\u2019re not spending time on that. But now, the division head or facilities manager can search for what they need very quickly.\u201d\n\nThe city of Fayetteville\u2019s security camera deployment has been very successful, so successful, in fact, that they now have a backlog of camera deployment requests. Government organizations across the city want Meraki MV installed after hearing success stories from their peers.\nTo start the next wave of deployment, the IT team plans to launch cameras in the city parking garages and recycling drop-off centers for increased security in these locations, as well as to monitor traffic patterns to see when the garage and centers are being most utilized. They also want to continue using the heat maps to make informed business decisions \u2014 like understanding when traffic is busiest at City Hall and make adjustments accordingly. The IT team is excited about the benefits Meraki MV brings to their organization and the community."

    "text": "Hollywood is a place where stars are continuously discovered and where filmmakers push the technological envelope to bring stories to life in new ways. Behind this constant evolution, Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF) has served as a consistent backdrop since 1921, a sense of stability in an industry where a lot can change in a short amount of time.\nFounded over 96 years ago by moviemaking legends such as Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin to provide support for the Hollywood community, MPTF hasn\u2019t strayed far from its roots. Today, the organization provides a senior living community, including a fitness center, a UCLA-MPTF primary care health and physical therapy center, a skilled nursing facility (with a memory care unit), and a geriatric behavioral health unit; a children\u2019s center in West Los Angeles; and a group of 16 social workers in the greater LA community \u2014 all geared toward ensuring a healthy, engaged, and purposeful lifestyle for active and retired workers in Hollywood.\nMPTF\u2019s main campus, sprawled across 46 acres in Woodland Hills, CA, is home to the organization\u2019s senior living campus, nursing facility, hospital, and corporate offices. It\u2019s a busy place humming with activity: 230 residents live on the campus, which has a large movie theater and a gym with a warm water therapy pool. Moreover, MPTF hosts at least five large events a year, including fundraisers that attract the who\u2019s who of Hollywood. To celebrate its 95th anniversary, MPTF brought around 800 guests, including Hollywood A-list celebrities like board member George Clooney, onto its campus.\nTo keep the buzzing campus running smoothly, Chris Livanos, Chief Information Officer, needed a solid network infrastructure in place. Not only do residents and guests expect seamless connectivity across their devices, but staff and contractors need reliable communication services to ensure activities run smoothly. \u201cWe have around 400 employees, with around 100-150 visitors on campus on any given day,\u201d Livanos said. \u201cThere are lots of activities going on. I would say that on an average day, with the residents included, there are around 1,000 people on campus.\u201d\nA few years ago, Livanos realized that MPTF\u2019s network needed an upgrade. The organization\u2019s network load had grown faster than the previous network could scale. Upgrading the legacy network piecemeal wasn\u2019t a viable option; the gear was extremely old, so it made more sense to replace the system entirely with more modern infrastructure. From a management standpoint, the old equipment was so complex that Livanos had to rely on a third party for configuration and ongoing maintenance. \u201cThis resulted in many mistakes, long turnaround times, and high levels of frustration with our internal IT group and our end users,\u201d Livanos said. \u201cIt was time for a change.\u201d\nLivanos asked his staff to trial a few Cisco Meraki access points, pitting them against access points from a couple of other vendors. MPTF\u2019s chosen partner representative, Josh Close from Presidio, recommended the head-to-head test. After a few weeks of testing, Livanos decided that Meraki was the way to go. \u201cJosh told us that if you want an easy, solid solution for your wireless, go with Meraki,\u201d Livanos said.\nLivanos set plans in motion for upgrading the organization\u2019s aging infrastructure to Meraki. First, MPTF replaced the old APs with just under 100 Meraki APs to provide more reliable and widespread wireless connectivity across the campus. To handle the load on the new APs, Livanos also had new Meraki access switches installed throughout the campus.\nThanks to Meraki, just a few people can support the network.\nChief Information Officer\n\n\u00a0\nBut Livanos didn\u2019t just stop at networking equipment: he also transitioned off the organization\u2019s old mobile device management software and onto Meraki Systems Manager, Cisco\u2019s official unified endpoint management (UEM) solution. \u201cWe liked Systems Manager because it was easy to use and played well with the iPhone and laptop clients on our network,\u201d Livanos said. \u201cOur old system had some issues here and there; Meraki SM makes it a lot less cumbersome to control our employees\u2019 phone, tablets, and laptops.\u201d\nIn a short amount of time, Livanos and his team saw impressive results from deploying Meraki. One of the pain points that staff, guests, and residents had encountered in recent years was difficulty acquiring a strong cellular connection. New construction on the campus is largely made out of glass and metal, which hindered good phone reception. Thanks to the excellent Wi-Fi coverage that now blankets the campus, people can now use Wi-Fi calling on their phones and no longer have to worry about spotty reception.\nWith Meraki, the team can use content filtering for certain groups of network users and protect users with Meraki\u2019s built-in advanced malware protection (AMP). Prior to Meraki, MPTF only had a basic firewall in place that couldn\u2019t provide adequate protection against newly emerging threats.\nBy far the biggest difference that Meraki made for the MPTF team was significantly reducing the workload on the organization\u2019s small IT team. At less than 10 individuals, the IT team needed a network solution that was easy to manage and troubleshoot. \u201cAll we have here is helpdesk services, a network manager, a network administrator, and app support,\u201d Livanos said.\nThe ease of use of the Meraki dashboard lets Livanos\u2019s small team easily manage the entire network stack in one place using an intuitive, web-based GUI. More individuals on the team now handle routine configurations, reducing the burden on higher-level staff. For example, lower-level staff can manage port configurations on Meraki switches in just a few clicks, resulting in quicker service and higher user satisfaction. The team also set up Auto VPN in just a few clicks \u2014 \u201cthis was ridiculously easy to set up,\u201d Livanos said \u2014 helping to reduce the organization\u2019s WAN costs.\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive than these initial results is how MPTF plans to expand and build on its Meraki network to modernize the living experience for residents and guests. To ensure faster, more secure Internet access for residents, MPTF is rapidly deploying more Meraki APs in residents\u2019 rooms and in the children\u2019s center, replacing consumer-grade equipment and connecting these networks to the main campus network via a secure VPN tunnel. MPTF also plans to add more ruggedized Meraki APs for outdoor coverage. These will not only provide a better user experience, but also support a more robust W-Fi-based security camera system.\nThe organization also plans to add more RFID door access control units around campus to make it easy for residents and staff to enter different buildings; these also rely on the Meraki infrastructure. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having an end-to-end Meraki network,\u201d Livanos said. \u201cWe feel it provides us with the best features, while enabling our team to be self-sufficient and to remain nimble in execution.\u201d\nBecause MPTF is a non-profit organization, funding can sometimes be tight. Even with that challenge, Livanos and his team believe Meraki is worth the investment. \u201cWe like Meraki all around \u2014 we like the ease of use and the quick response times. It\u2019s easy to deploy and we don\u2019t have to constantly rely on third parties to configure and manage it,\u201d Livanos said. \u201cMeraki helps us focus on doing what we do best: fostering a close-knit community for everyone in Hollywood.\u201d"

    "text": "Ascend Public Charter Schools is a Charter Management Organization (CMO) focused on building, maintaining, and supporting charter schools in Brooklyn, New York. Their lower, middle, and high schools grow organically, starting at the lowest grade level, with new grades added as students graduate each year. Ascend is growing at an extremely rapid pace; they had 4 schools across 4 buildings in 2013, 10 schools across 8 buildings in 2017, and have plans to be at 13 schools in 11 buildings by the summer of 2018.\n\nWhen Emeka Ibekweh, Managing Director of Technology at Ascend Public Charter Schools, started in 2013, he was responsible for managing four schools spread across four buildings, all with different networks. The network equipment was very outdated, and had separate wireless controllers and slow VPN connections, requiring Ibekweh to physically be on-site to manage upgrades, firmware updates, and configurations. \u201cJust the complexity of managing four sites with four separate networks was a nightmare, to say the least,\u201d said Ibekweh.\nBeyond the complications of operating a separate network at each school, there was also very limited wireless coverage throughout each building. One of the six-story buildings only had 12 access points, which provided limited wireless access for students and staff. They also had no planned IT budget, making purchasing an entirely new network infrastructure a daunting prospect. Ibekweh desperately needed a solution that would streamline Ascend\u2019s four networks into one, provide complete visibility into network usage, and allow for simplified management \u2014 all with a non-existent budget.\nWe wanted to be able to streamline and simplify configuration and management under one dashboard. To be able to make changes across the board, across all sites, without having to make the same configuration changes multiple times at each location.\nManaging Director of Technology\n\nAfter applying for and receiving E-rate funding, Ibekweh knew he had to spend it wisely to make his network refresh a reality. Having used Cisco before, he knew the products were reliable and built to last, with support that was always available when needed. So Ibekweh and his five-person IT team decided to demo Cisco Meraki access points, switches, and security appliances. After seeing how easy it was to make configuration changes, view network traffic, and create separate and secure SSIDs, all from a single dashboard, Ibekweh was sold. With their E-rate funding, Ibekweh was able to purchase the network infrastructure he needed to succeed.\nIbekweh started his deployment by ripping out all of his legacy switches and replacing them with MS420s at the core, and MS320s at the access level. Instantly, the switch features in the dashboard proved invaluable. Ibekweh can now quickly and easily run a remote cable test to pinpoint network issues and use the automatic loop detection to find redundant uplink ports. \u201cThe port-level granular visibility through the dashboard was definitely a game changer for us,\u201d Ibekweh said.\nThe access point deployment took half the time it would have with a competitive product. With every MR42 and MR34 preconfigured in the Meraki dashboard, all Ibekweh and his team had to do was scan each access point\u2019s barcode with their mobile phone, name it, plug it in, and mount it. That was it. In all, Ibekweh\u2019s team has now deployed 257 access points across their eight buildings, with one access point in every classroom. By managing the access points through the dashboard, Ibekweh can easily troubleshoot a problem \u2014 he can quickly see which access points teachers are connected to and simply identify if there are bottlenecks or bandwidth hogging applications. He can also identify VLAN mismatching issues, see the amount of traffic on the network at any given time, as well as view the number of devices and clients.\nJust seeing the amount of traffic, the type of traffic, and the number of devices and clients on the network \u2013 we weren\u2019t able to see that before \u2013 that\u2019s huge for us.\nManaging Director of Technology\n\nThis past summer, Ibekweh and his team deployed a Meraki MX400 security appliance at each of their sites. With these security appliances providing protection for each site, the team could configure two secure VLANs to host two separate SSIDs: one VLAN dedicated to the primary, or staff, wireless network, and the second VLAN dedicated to a guest network. The staff network is used for all Ascend-owned devices, while the guest network is used for any BYOD devices. For the guest network, Ibekweh uses traffic shaping rules to limit the amount of bandwidth, single-sign on with Meraki authentication, SSID scheduling so the network is not available after hours, and content filtering to block inappropriate websites. Having a secure gateway to control all of their guest traffic, combined with site-to-site VPN and DHCP, has been a game-changer for Ascend.\n\nMoving forward, Ascend is continuing to future-proof their new and existing network infrastructure with new technologies and features to continue improving student learning. In the short term, Ibekweh plans to use the port scheduling feature on his switches to turn off certain ports at night and on the weekends to save on energy costs. Their biggest long-term decision is determining whether Ascend wants to implement a 1:1 student-to-device initiative. If they do, a separate student SSID would be on the horizon, since currently all student traffic is going through the primary network. They are also looking into deploying Meraki security cameras at schools that do not currently have cameras. Further down the line, they plan to evaluate Meraki Systems Manager for enterprise mobility management. Whatever Ascend decides to do next, Meraki will be there to continue expanding and future-proofing their network.\n"

    "text": "When David Termunde joined Arbor Park School District as Chief Technology Officer, he encountered a network that lacked complete visibility, something he knew he needed in order to provide the best experience for students. His goal was to deploy a reliable network across the district\u2019s four schools and school bus transportation center to better support 1,300 students and 210 teachers and staff. With only four people on the IT team, Termunde wanted a solution that would be easy for a lean team to manage and troubleshoot, and, because the IT team doesn\u2019t have a full-time security engineer, it had to be something they could install and manage on their own, without expensive training.\nTermunde had prior experience using Cisco Meraki, so when he joined Arbor Park, he knew it would be a great fit for the district\u2019s needs. He decided to start with a solution that would provide the visibility they had been lacking: an MX250 security appliance. The MX250 replaced three existing network items including a firewall, router, and switch.\nBecause each building is connected over the WAN, the school district only needed one firewall to support all five locations. Termunde and his team installed the MX in the middle of the school year on a Thursday evening. They had planned to be on-site for several hours, but by pre-configuring the hardware in the Meraki dashboard before it arrived, along with the easy installation process, the MX was ready to go in an hour and a half.\nPreviously, the team didn\u2019t have any visibility into the clients on the network. Termunde explained, \u201cThe Meraki MX populates all of the clients on the network. We installed on a Thursday and when we checked back the next day, we were able to see and sort Apple devices, Chromebooks, PCs and other clients that were on the network. That data has been really beneficial.\u201d They now have a complete overview of the endpoints on the network. They are even able to quickly identify bottlenecks, catching three in the first week of using the MX. With this additional visibility, Meraki has enabled the IT team to make informed decisions about their current network infrastructure and plan for future projects.\nIs our internet fast enough? Do we need more speed? Where are the bottlenecks in our network? We were able to answer these questions thanks to the Meraki MX.\nChief Technology Officer\n\nThe Arbor Park IT team uses a variety of features on the MX. For Termunde, content filtering is incredibly important. It is required for CIPA compliance, which is needed for the district to receive their E-rate funding. He also works closely with teachers to whitelist and blacklist websites accordingly. Traffic shaping rules cap Netflix and Hulu bandwidth to ensure equitable access to the Internet for the entire student body. During state testing, Termunde sets a group policy to meet the recommended network requirements provided by the testing vendors. This allows the students to have uninterrupted connectivity while testing. The Meraki dashboard allows for viewing of any clients or network issues during testing so the team can be proactive before a problem arises.\nThe Security Center in the dashboard aggregates intrusion detection and retrospective malware detection threats and provides a single view illustrating any potential threats on the network. Termunde and his team receive notifications when threats occur, allowing them to quickly pinpoint the problem clients and clean or reimage if necessary. The Meraki solution also eliminates the need for duplicate and expensive client-based protection.\nAfter having so much success with the Meraki MX, the team decided to install two 8-port Meraki MS switches to manage the schools\u2019 servers. Each server is plugged into a switch port, enabling the team to receive alerts if a server loses connectivity. For example, the HVAC system for the entire district is managed through the network, so Termunde often finds out  when an HVAC computer goes offline even before the maintenance department does. \u201cWe try and be as proactive as possible, and without Meraki we wouldn\u2019t be able to do that. Before, we\u2019d have to wait for someone to call and tell us about an issue on the network and now, we find the issues before the end-user,\u201d Termunde stated.\nIn the future, the Arbor Park IT team plans to replace their core infrastructure with Meraki MS switches, with a 48-port switch at each school site for additional network monitoring capabilities. As a part of larger project, Termunde is investigating implementing other Meraki devices including switches, cameras, and MDM. Until then, Termunde will continue to take advantage of the enhanced visibility Meraki has provided. \u201cThe data our MX has given us has really helped us move the network forward,\u201d he said."

One business arm of N Kid Group\u2019s operations is tiNiWorld, a family edutainment centre where kids can play at safe an indoor playground under the supervision of their parents. Khoa Do, Chief Technology Officer, is responsible for the building a reliable network this fast-growing organisation with over 25 centres and 2,500 employees.\nWhile the kids are playing inside the centres, the parents are inside with them and they request WiFi to help them pass the time. Do and his team initially installed consumer-grade wireless access points, but they faced issues with performance, parents had trouble connecting as they were unable to serve a large number of clients at peak times.\nCustomers would complain about not being able to connect to the Wi-Fi or that the Wi-Fi was slow. \u201cOften at peak times, employees would also hear that customers were being kicked off the Wi-Fi,\u201d said Do.\nWith up to 500 customers connecting at the same time, Do and his team needed an enterprise-grade wireless solution at their centres. With just three members on the IT team, and distributed sites across Vietnam, Do needed a solution that would simplify networks management and allow for remote troubleshooting.\nDo was at a local coffee shop in Vietnam when he went to log onto the Wi-Fi and saw a Cisco Meraki splash page. He read up on the Meraki story, adding \u201cI come from a tech background, so that\u2019s why I think the Meraki story coming up with the idea of managing networks on the cloud is exciting. This made me excited to learn more about the company,\u201d said Do.\nDo and his team decided to give Meraki a try, saying \u201cWe liked how cloud-managed networking is so easy and straightforward \u2014 we are able to run the whole network from at one place.\u201d Do also liked that Meraki could help them future-proof their centres and provide advanced analytics. \u201dWe were looking for an enterprise grade solution that would be able to support a larger number of clients with more advanced features such as analytics and location heatmaps, and those were some of the incentives of choosing Meraki\u201d Do said.\nThe IT team reached out to a local partner in Vietnam and requested a proof-of-concept with the Meraki MR33 wireless access point.\nIt is so cool, so easy, and straightforward. We don\u2019t have to install anything. We can run all of the network from one place,\nChief Technology Officer, N Kid Group\nDo and the team started with three MR33 wireless access points to trial at their flagship tiNiworld centre in  Ho Chi Minh City, located inside the Takashimaya department store. \u201cWith three access points, we were able to test different parts of the site to see how the systems benefit from having the Meraki technology,\u201d Do explained.\nDuring the Meraki proof-of-concept, the team was able to demonstrate the ease of management while supporting a larger number of clients.  \u201cIt is so cool, so easy, and straightforward. We don\u2019t have to install anything. We can run all of the network from one place. We can see if they are down, or if they are up, how many connections they have,\u201d said Do. In addition, Do saw improvements in wireless performance for a high number of clients something that their previous vendor was not able to provide.\nAfter this successful proof-of-concept, the CEO allocated budget to deploy Meraki wireless at one of their new Tiniworld centres.\nSince switching over to Meraki from their previous solution, Do and his team have noted that they have less complaints from centre employees around customers trying to connect to the WiFi. \u201cCustomers are now able to enjoy a more stable wireless experience since we moved over to Meraki,\u201d said Do.\nThanks to the Meraki dashboard, Do and his team now have additional insight into their customers. \u201cWe now can see how many customers have iOS, and how many have Android. In addition, the dashboard provides information in terms of visitor frequency and loyal, which tells the business how often certain customers visit certain centres. This kind of insight helps us understand our customers more, and we now have more data around customer behaviour to allow us to market to our customers more effectively.\u201d\nDeploying Meraki has improved the network at N Kid Group. \u201cI think what I like best about Meraki is the centralized management and the transparency of all the features. You can access everywhere anytime \u2014 whether that be on the website or on mobile device, and it works really well,\u201d said Do.\nUntil now, Do and his team focused on using  Meraki to support as many clients as possible at the centres. Moving forward, Do and his team are looking into the other features with Meraki, like splash pages. \u201cWe always wanted the landing page setup for our customers for local marketing. We haven\u2019t done it yet, but in the coming months, we will be preparing to deploy our custom landing page using the Meraki network,\u201d said Do."

    "text": "For Stephen Dawe, Chief Technology Officer at The City of Opelika, becoming a smart city means a lot more than piloting and implementing the latest technologies. It\u2019s about improving quality of life, furthering economic development, increasing educational opportunities, being good stewards of citywide resources, cutting down on crime, and reducing the digital divide. It\u2019s about using technology to benefit the entire community, help businesses succeed, and make government bodies more effective and efficient. However, before Dawe could even start thinking about making Opelika a smart city, he needed to determine a strategy for providing adequate network access in the areas that needed it most.\n\nOpelika, located in east Alabama, is the 11th fastest growing area in the United States, with around 36,000 residents covering 55 sq. miles. Dawe and his seven-person team are responsible for managing the IT infrastructure across the entire city, including all applications, data centers, wireless access, and other technologies used for departments such as police, parks and recreation, and fire. Dawe and his team are focused on delivering the best experiences for city employees and the general public and are continuously evaluating new technologies that can benefit the city, while remaining feasible and cost effective. When residents asked for wireless access at the city\u2019s sportsplex, Dawe began evaluating vendors that could handle thousands of devices on the network at once\u2014and that the mayor\u2019s office would approve of.\nDawe has been a Cisco customer for years, so when he heard about the ease of management with Cisco Meraki access points, he decided to give them a try. The access points provided quick installation, easy provisioning, simplified troubleshooting, and network monitoring; so Dawe decided to deploy them at not only the Sportsplex, but also at city parks, the tennis center, three fire stations, the public works facility, environmental services, city hall, and the courts administrations building\u2014just to start. He also deployed Meraki MS switches at several locations, with Cisco Catalyst switches supporting the underlying network infrastructure.\nMeraki access points have dramatically changed how residents and workers connect to the city network by utilizing indoor access points for government workers to do their jobs, outdoor access points for parents to live stream their child\u2019s soccer games, and wireless security cameras to monitor equipment sheds that are connected over the Wi-Fi network. In the fire stations, firefighters can access the network 24/7 while fire trucks can be monitored wirelessly while in the engine bays. The public works facility provides connections inside and outside so employees can go online no matter where they are working, and security cameras can connect back over the network. Most impressively, are the connections at the Sportsplex, with coverage inside the gym, swimming pools, baseball diamonds, and five soccer fields. On soccer nights, around 900 people regularly connect to the network without a hitch, and the network even supported approximately 5,000 people at the state swim championship.\nTuesday is soccer night, so every Tuesday there are between 700 and 900 users on the guest network, and it works like a charm.\nChief Technology Officer, City of Opelika\nBeyond customer satisfaction with the wireless connections across the city, the IT team has realized several benefits since moving to Meraki. Deploying and configuring the access points was extremely easy: they just added them onto the correct VLAN and they were ready to go. With the built-in management tools in the Meraki dashboard, the team can easily monitor the traffic coming over the wireless network, see where users are accessing the network with heatmaps, get a breakdown of the devices and applications in use, and make adjustments accordingly via a web browser. Dawe highlighted, \u201cBefore Christmas, I was out of town at a function with one of my children, and there was a network problem. I just opened up the app and fixed it from my phone.\u201d Dawe also has much more control over the network with the ability to limit application and session bandwidth for each client or for the SSID.\nMeraki access points also give an added level of security. Dawe breaks down the city\u2019s SSIDs by department and offers a guest network which enables the team to enforce an access control list at every access point and at the switch level, providing two layers of security. They are also using firewall and traffic-shaping rules on the access points. Person-to-person (P2P) applications are blocked, and with the rules enforced on the access point, rather then the controller, it saves them a lot of bandwidth on the network and provides increased security. The team can also easily track and shut down rogue devices on the network. If someone plugs a wireless router into the office network, the Meraki network detects it and stops the device from connecting. For threat management and to detect network hackers and failing devices, they use a SIEM tool that is connected to the Meraki dashboard through an API. If there are more than 200 connections per minute from a single device trying to connect to one access point, Dawe receives an email and can easily ban the suspicious IP or MAC addresses.\nManaging the access points and switches is much easier with Meraki. Only two members on the IT team know how to configure networking equipment with command line. By configuring and monitoring the devices through the Meraki dashboard, the entire team can manage the network, saving time and reducing troubleshooting to allow them to better allocate resources. With the time saved, the team has put a focus on researching and deploying smart city applications and technologies that put Opelika ahead of the curve in its mission to become a digital city.\nWith Meraki, managing the wireless network is so much easier. It has saved us time, allowing us to work on other things. As a city, we have some smart city initiatives, and getting time to work on that is crucial.\nChief Technology Officer, City of Opelika\n\nDue to the time saved with Meraki, Dawe was able to spearhead the development of a strategy for becoming a smart city. With a systematic and thoughtful approach, Dawe analyzed various smart city initiatives to decide which projects to take on first. After looking at demand, financial feasibility, technological capability, and alignment to the city\u2019s mission, Dawe chose three citywide initiatives to start with: public Wi-Fi in city buildings and parks, environmental sensors, and street lights.\nAs the digital divide continues to grow, Dawe looks at internet access as a basic right. Everyone needs electricity and access to clean water, and they also need access to the internet if they are going to succeed in today\u2019s world economy. He explored the possibility of putting Wi-Fi across Opelika\u2019s entire 55 sq. miles, but due to vast forested areas, the team decided to focus on deploying wireless coverage in high-traffic areas. The plan is to roll out public Wi-Fi in underserved areas, public libraries, and all government-owned buildings and areas, so that people can access the internet when and where they need it. Bridging the digital divide will not only improve the quality of life, but also provide more economic opportunities for residents. Dawe plans to have Meraki wireless spread across the city in the next few years.\nIn order to support city sustainability projects, Dawe started exploring the concept of sensors, where he could implement them, what value they would add, and what the cost would be. In partnership with Cisco, Opelika is the first city in North America to deploy Cisco\u2019s LoRaWAN-compliant solution, which provides long-distance wireless connectivity for IoT endpoints at a low cost and with low power consumption. Operating at 915 MHz, Dawe can support over 1,000 sensors across the entire city. Opelika has also partnered with Auburn University to help the city understand the benefits of the sensors and how the data should affect decision-making. They also ensure that the city is measuring the correct indicators to see the value. Sensors are being installed to monitor parking, nitric oxide levels, industrial park gases, and water quality. The city currently has 30 sensors deployed and is looking to add more as they decide how to most effectively collect and use the data.\nWith the help of Cisco, the biggest project for the city is implementing controllable LED street lights. In partnership with Cisco and CIMCON lighting, Dawe is installing sensors on top of the street lights that connect back to the Cisco gateway. Dawe chose this project because it could cut the city\u2019s street light electric bill by 50% by allowing him to control when the lights dim during low activity and brighten when cars and people go by.\nThe City of Opelika is moving into unchartered territory, leading the way for cities across the United States to determine and implement the right technologies that will truly make a difference for residents. The Cisco-based city-wide fiber network coupled with Meraki Wi-Fi ensures a scalable and flexible technology foundation that will easily allow the addition of new technologies. Dawe will continue to research new technologies and solutions as they emerge and move forward with them if they support quality of life, economic development, and sustainability."

    "text": "In 2002, Matt Cimaglia, having recently graduated from college,identified a burgeoning opportunity to use new technology in the video and creative industry to create unique experiences and strategic campaigns. Eager to shape the future of this industry, Cimaglia founded Cimaglia Productions believing that digital marketing\u2014not boilerplate business models from traditional agencies\u2014is what drives innovation. Since then, Cimaglia Productions has been spearheading campaigns for some of the world\u2019s top companies. The common theme? Innovation.\nOver the years, Cimaglia Productions has expanded from South Florida to Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. By tailoring talent and services to each client\u2019s needs, Cimaglia Productions is constantly finding unique ways to tell their clients\u2019 stories through experiential marketing, high quality video production, and digital media. \u201cWe spend a lot of time listening to our clients and understanding their companies before we start anything creative,\u201d explains Matt Cimaglia, CEO and Founder. \u201cThat way, we can bridge their needs with our expertise in the digital landscape and aim beyond their expectations, offering up a creative, non-traditional solution they might not have thought of.\u201d\n\nOne client in particular, Heart Six Ranch, an authentic dude ranch with over 100 years of history in Wyoming, planned to relaunch as a luxury resort all while keeping the rich culture. To do so, they were in need of a new marketing strategy and brand identity. The goal was to create a brand and experience that reached people all over the globe, as well as guests staying on the ranch. Cimaglia Productions wanted to take on the client, but there were some unique challenges that came with creating a marketing campaign for a deployment based in one of the most remote locations in the continental U.S., with the nearest store being more than 40 miles away.\nFirst, the ranch\u2019s network infrastructure needed a significant upgrade. Although Cimaglia Productions is more of a creative agency, that transition took place before anything else. The new underlying technology would lead the way for the ranch\u2019s future advancement, while also test Cimaglia\u2019s skills in an expanded setting.\n\nThe ranch prepared to build a formal network architecture spanning the 83-acre property. Cimaglia Productions envisioned login splash pages for guests that could later serve marketing content, video ads, and promotional materials to improve guest experiences. They also wanted to use iBeacons to track guests\u2019 behavior and movements throughout the ranch to maximize engagement. For this, they needed innovative wireless technology.\nIn the past, Cimaglia Productions internally deployed Cisco Meraki solutions because of the security required to support its robust client roster, many of which involve sensitive data. \u201cOur company is always focused on future-proofing our networks, and security is paramount in that,\u201d Cimaglia said. \u201cI already knew Meraki was reliable, since we used it internally and it\u2019s always up to date with the latest security updates and VPN tunneling.\u201d\nFor Heart Six Ranch, Cimaglia Productions started by ripping out the consumer-grade wireless routers from the main lodge, which provided limited connectivity and spotty coverage. Meraki enterprise-grade wireless access points were deployed throughout the location. Eventually, Cimaglia upgraded the whole ranch to the full Meraki stack, which includes APs, switches, security appliances, and even MC phones. This new design will help improve future guest experiences, and help the ranch accommodate large corporate groups or even productions and events on their property.\nBack in New York, the Cimaglia Productions team can remotely manage the Wyoming ranch\u2019s security appliances through the Meraki dashboard, allowing the team to troubleshoot the most critical equipment from miles away. He also set rules like group policies, SSIDs, and Auto-VPN.\nSimilarly, with the switches, remote teams can identify port issues or device problems all through the dashboard. \u201cStreamlining our equipment and data into a single dashboard has saved us and our clients time, energy and money,\u201d said Cimaglia.\n\nAfter the network infrastructure was deployed, Cimaglia Productions focused on creating unique experiences for Heart Six Ranch and other clients. With reliable technology, they were able to solve many of the initial challenges Heart Six had previously faced.\nCimaglia Productions was able to accomplish their original goal of implementing splash pages to capture email addresses and fuel the ranch\u2019s marketing engine. They also established Bluetooth location tracking to see where guests were moving throughout the ranch.\nFor example, with reliable wireless coverage, guests can connect seamlessly from anywhere on the ranch. They also built customized diagnostic systems to assess network connectivity, which was provided by a local carrier. They also hardwired Meraki ruggedized APs that withstand temperatures up to -30 degrees throughout the ranch.\nAdditionally, nature can be unpredictable\u2014one day a sheet of ice fell and severed a pipe housing the fiber connection. Without Meraki, part of the network would have failed; however, due to automatic failover capabilities in Meraki appliances, the wireless connection was able to keep running at the ranch, pivoting to an access point within close range and turning into a repeater.\nCimaglia Productions is excited to continue using Meraki solutions in a unique way to drive innovation at Heart Six Ranch and with other clients. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see how Meraki evolves their technology,\u201d Cimaglia said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a business as fast-moving as the tech world, it\u2019s critical to align yourself with like-minded companies and people who understand what it means to stay innovative, aware and future-oriented. For us, Meraki fits that directive perfectly.\u201d"

    "text": "With thousands of iPads and iPhones deployed to 200,000 students, teachers, and admins, a large Canadian school board is a firm believer in the power of technology to transform learning.\nMatthew Smith*, one of the school board\u2019s Systems Analysts, and his team take care of large, district-wide projects and support a distributed team of PC, LAN, and field technicians.\nAbout two years ago, Smith became painfully aware of the need for a robust enterprise mobility management (EMM) system to manage all of the school district\u2019s iOS devices. The district deploys over 26,000 iPads and 900 iPhones across 270 school sites, a massive number of devices by any stretch of the imagination. Though the school board had been using the devices to enhance lessons in the classroom for over four years, it had yet to adopt and implement an EMM solution, instead leaving it up to individual schools and administrators to manage their own fleet of devices. \u201cIt was sort of the Wild West out there,\u201d Smith admits. \u201cField technicians at each school were using MacBooks as configuration stations, but so many things could go wrong \u2014 if a MacBook got stolen, all configurations would be lost.\u201d\nThe school district\u2019s IT team knew implementing an EMM solution was crucial given the wide variety of use cases for the iOS devices district-wide. Teachers regularly use the devices to present lessons \u2014 some of the schools use 150 different apps for learning \u2014 and students use the devices\u2019 cameras and video editing capabilities to create video projects. Since the devices are shared (students don\u2019t have their own iPads and they rarely take the tablets home), it\u2019s important that they always have the right sets of apps and profiles installed. \u201cThe kids grab the iPads off of a cart wheeled into the classroom, and that\u2019s their lesson for the day,\u201d Smith says.\nThe school board conducted an extensive RFP process, inviting multiple vendors to bid for the opportunity to deploy an EMM solution spread across the entire school district. After running a pilot with several vendors and testing out different features and functionalities across different groups of schools, the board chose to adopt Cisco Meraki\u2019s EMM solution, Systems Manager.\nAs soon as Systems Manager was decided upon, Smith and his team went to work on enrolling all of the district\u2019s iOS devices. Despite the school district\u2019s decentralized structure \u2014 each school has its own network and often its own set of apps, since the district is comprised of elementary, middle, and high schools \u2014 Smith found this process easy. The team used network tagging, a feature of Systems Manager, to tag each network with keywords (e.g., \u201celementary\u201d or \u201cspecial education\u201d), making it simple to enroll devices in bulk and provision them appropriately.\nFor the school board, the biggest benefit of Meraki Systems Manager is the ability to quickly deploy apps across different devices. The district uses Apple\u2019s Volume Purchasing Program (VPP) to download free and paid apps and then uses Systems Manager to silently install those apps on many devices all at once.\nSmith and his team also use Systems Manager to provision device profiles, push Wi-Fi settings, and manage inventory. Smith says Systems Manager makes it simple to configure Wi-Fi on new devices, traditionally a slow and manual process. \u201cI have a test network with profiles on it, and when a new school comes into play or a new network needs to be created, I\u2019ll create the network and use a clone of the profile to copy the Wi-Fi profile,\u201d Smith says.\nWhen the unexpected occurs \u2014 and things can certainly get unpredictable with so many devices deployed in so many places \u2014 Systems Manager helps the school district keep everything in order. If an iPad is lost or stolen, Smith can remotely lock it and push a message to the device while working in conjunction with local police to locate the iPad. Moreover, some iPads belonging to certain departments (e.g., special education) need to be specially provisioned. Systems Manager lets Smith do this in just a few clicks.\n[The messaging feature] ensures that we keep devices protected from the latest threats, while we avoid angering busy administrators by updating their devices without advanced warning\nSystems Analyst\n\n\u00a0\nMeraki Systems Manager has also helped the school board save money by repurposing old devices. The district issues iPhones to employees at administrator level and above so they can check their email and be productive even when they\u2019re on the go. When the district decided to purchase iPhone 7 devices for employees, it took the old iPhone 5 devices and configured them with Cisco Jabber using Systems Manager. These older iPhones were then handed to custodial staff, replacing an even older set of pagers. The custodians could then respond to service requests much faster by using instant messenger.\nFrom a security standpoint, Smith has found Systems Manager extremely useful for keeping thousands of iPads and iPhones up-to-date and secured with the latest security patches. \u201cWe found that people often cancel updates when they come out of nowhere,\u201d Smith says. With Systems Manager, the school district uses the messaging feature to automatically push a notification to every device when an update is available, encouraging the user to apply the update. These notifications repeat a couple of times before a final warning, after which the update is automatically applied. \u201cThe messaging function allows us to communicate better with every user,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cIt ensures that we keep devices protected from the latest threats, while we avoid angering busy administrators by updating their devices without advanced warning.\u201d\nAs the school district deploys even more iOS devices in classrooms and schools in the future, Meraki Systems Manager will continue to simplify the provisioning and management process for the district. Smith is excited for that future. \u201cWe open up 2-3 schools a year, so as we order hundreds of new devices, Systems Manager makes it simple to get them all set up and ready to go,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of our most-used systems because it does exactly what we need it to do.\u201d\n*Name changed to protect anonymity"

    "text": "Yongsan International School of Seoul (YISS) is an international school in the heart of Seoul, Korea, and offers an American curriculum for expatriate families. Located within the international district of Itaewon, YISS has 1,000 students hailing from 55 different countries, supported by 175 staff members.YISS prides itself on offering an education that equals what students can receive in the United States, while also providing a diverse environment where students can make friends from all over the world. For example, the athletic teams play against other international schools, attending competitions in Guam, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand \u2014 presenting students with unique opportunities that they would not have in the U.S.\nBrendon McCarthy is the Director of Technology at YISS and oversees technology infrastructure, ranging from network and printing to classroom projectors, along with educational technology initiatives. McCarthy explains that the school\u2019s previous network was lacking visibility. \u201cIt was a black hole,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d Even though the previous system had standard features such as layer 3 firewall support, the team was unable to efficiently manage even basic firewall and switch settings because they were not accessible or required command line operations \u2014 it often required working through a partner vendor, which was difficult due to lack of in-house networking expertise and English-language support. These issues prompted McCarthy to look for a new solution.\nIn addition to in-language support, it was a firm requirement that the new networking solution be cloud-managed, as YISS does not maintain any on-premise servers. While researching options for a cloud-managed network solution, McCarthy heard about Cisco Meraki via a former university classmate who worked in enterprise IT. He attended Meraki webinars to learn more and was pleased to discover the high level of visibility and control that was possible with the Meraki web-based dashboard. Other solutions were evaluated too; however, unlike Meraki, they did not offer the option of a centrally managed system through which access points, switches, security, and enterprise mobility management could all be managed from a single dashboard.\nAfter evaluating and deciding upon the Meraki solution, YISS installed 174 MR access points, 42 MS switches, one MX security appliance, and purchased licenses to support 750 devices with Meraki\u2019s enterprise mobility management (EMM) solution, Systems Manager.\nWith the intuitive Meraki dashboard, McCarthy and his team have access to and visibility of all features, analytics, and client information. They can easily make changes and optimize the network themselves by simply making a couple of clicks within the dashboard.\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to easily modify settings and configurations on our own, thanks to the top-notch customer support and documentation on the Meraki website.\u201d\nBecause McCarthy and his team were limited in ability to interact with Korean vendors efficiently due to experience and language difficulties, Meraki\u2019s exemplary customer service and in-language support was a major reason why he selected Meraki as the network solution for YISS. McCarthy notes that international schools worldwide are all struggling with the same issues and having reliable in-language support is crucial. Meraki offers customer support in not only English but in four other languages as well.\n\u201cIf we have any questions, I can call somebody who speaks my language [English] and can walk me through the steps needed. We didn\u2019t have that before,\u201d McCarthy explains.\nMcCarthy\u2019s team of three is quite lean \u2014 half the size of a typical size team supporting the same number of students. Because YISS does not have a network engineer or professionally trained networking staff, the ease of use of the Meraki system was a key factor in YISS\u2019 decision to adopt Meraki. With the previous system, the staff would not be able to tell if the system was down or not, without having to call the vendor. With Meraki, the team is able to see if there is an issue and can quickly determine if it is an issue they are able to resolve on their own or not via the dashboard. If not, they can call the English or Korean-based customer support.\n\u201cWe wanted a system that runs itself, and that wouldn\u2019t require someone who is a certified network technician. Any of my staff can get into the dashboard, figure things out, and make configuration changes, all without having to call a specialist for help,\u201d McCarthy explains.\nSince deploying Meraki, support requests to the IT department have decreased significantly. With the previous system, there were frequent issues with connectivity. With Meraki, the connectivity problems have disappeared, and the lean team at YISS is able to focus on their other responsibilities and projects.\nMcCarthy enjoys having the ability to continue optimizing the network as needed and being able to do this in incremental phases without disrupting the network. For example, YISS has combined SSIDs into a single SSID for both students and staff. The switch was easily achieved by using group policies and assigning the policies to different VLANs for students and staff members, keeping them separated virtually without having to split the groups onto separate networks. \u201cIt\u2019s great to know that we can make any change in just a few minutes,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\u201cOur goal is that no one whom we support should worry whether the internet is going to work or not at any moment of any day. It should just work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe infrastructure should be invisible. That\u2019s exactly what Meraki is helping us to accomplish.\u201d\nYISS is part of a network of 17 international schools in 14 countries. Currently, each school is managed independently when it comes to networking infrastructure; however, several other schools in the network have begun to adopt Meraki as well. The benefit is that the schools can have the same networking technology anywhere. McCarthy looks forward to having the ability to manage multiple school networks centrally from the cloud and for other schools in the network to also enjoy all of the same benefits that YISS has been delighted by since adopting Meraki."

    "text": "TRAINM is een pionier in de gezondheidszorg op het gebied van post-revalidatie. Pati\u00ebnten met een neurologische aandoening zoals cerebrale parese, MS, Parkinson en dwarslaesies kunnen er terecht om met behulp van robotica en andere innovatieve technologie\u00ebn verder vooruitgang te boeken na hun initi\u00eble revalidatie. Dit betekent dat ze per sessie gemiddeld 20 keer meer bewegingen van de ledematen kunnen uitvoeren in vergelijking met conventionele kinesitherapie.\nEdward Schiettecatte staat naast zijn echtgenote Nilofar Niazi, de oprichtster en CEO van TRAINM, aan het roer van het centrum. Gemotiveerd door wetenschappelijk onderzoek dat pati\u00ebnten zelfs jaren nadat een neurologische ziekte is opgetreden nog heel wat vooruitgang kunnen boeken, wilden zij deze innovatieve manier van revalideren toegankelijk maken voor iedereen. Intussen telt hun centrum zeven werknemers en 150 regionale en internationale pati\u00ebnten. Naast hun passie en ervaring kon een uitstekende IT-infrastructuur daarom ook niet ontbreken.\nHet was Edward die op zoek ging naar de gepaste oplossing voor hun netwerk. Er was op dat moment al een systeem ge\u00efnstalleerd om de muziek in het centrum te beheren, maar uiteindelijk werd duidelijk dat niets vlot werkte. \u201cDat was frustrerend en vanuit die optiek hebben we nagedacht over wie we kunnen aanspreken om dat echt professioneel te doen,\u201d vertelde hij.\nWe wilden alle problemen tegelijk oplossen en alles via \u00e9\u00e9n centraal platform beheren, zowel het internet als de beveiligingscamera\u2019s, enzovoort.\nCo-founder\n\n\u00a0\nDe keuze voor Cisco Meraki was vrij natuurlijk. Edward was altijd al onder de indruk van het Cisco portfolio en contacteerde daarom een van de Belgische verdelers. Na een bezoek ter plaatse bij TRAINM in Antwerpen, merkten zij dat het IT-gebeuren inderdaad niet zo goed was opgezet en werd er beslist om over te schakelen naar een cloud-managed netwerk van Cisco Meraki. \u201cDe verdeler zorgde voor de volledige installatie van het nieuwe netwerk en de service was daarbovenop heel professioneel,\u201d vertelde Edward.\nAangezien TRAINM momenteel nog geen IT-verantwoordelijke heeft, komt het beheer via een centraal dashboard erg goed van pas. Wanneer er wat mis gaat in het netwerk kan Edward bovendien niet enkel rekenen op de hulp van het Meraki support team (dat 24/7 beschikbaar is), maar in dit geval ook op die van de verdeler zelf.\nDe IT-infrastructuur van TRAINM bestaat uit een MX UTM device, drie MS switches, zeven MR access points en tien MV beveiligingscamera\u2019s. De MX ligt aan de basis van het netwerk en opereert als unified threat management device. Het apparaat biedt functies zoals content filtering, firewall, advanced malware protection en veel meer. Deze zijn allemaal eenvoudig in te stellen in het dashboard met slechts enkele kliks. Hierdoor is TRAINM gerustgesteld dankzij een veilig netwerk dat, wanneer nodig, ongewenst verkeer blokkeert en identificeert.\nDe drie switches zijn een essentieel onderdeel van het netwerk om vlot verkeer te voorzien. Dankzij de zichtbaarheid in het dashboard kan het team zelfs vanop afstand troubleshooten en bijvoorbeeld packet captures of kabeltesten uitvoeren. De zeven access points die hiermee verbonden zijn, verlenen momenteel toegang tot het netwerk aan de hand van drie SSIDs. Twee daarvan zijn toegewijd aan de robotica en interne processen, de derde opereert als SSID voor gasten waarop ingelogd kan worden met een wachtwoord. Het TRAINM team kan dit eenvoudig wijzigen naar bijvoorbeeld SMS of Facebook login. Daarnaast is er ook een bandbreedte-limiet ingesteld op het gastennetwerk, wat per SSID of per verbonden apparaat gekozen kan worden.\nNaast de essenti\u00eble netwerkonderdelen maakt TRAINM ook gebruik van Meraki\u2019s beveiligingscamera\u2019s. Deze zijn eveneens ge\u00efntegreerd in het dashboard en beelden worden op de camera\u2019s zelf opgeslagen, waardoor er geen extra software of hardware nodig is. \u201cCamera\u2019s zijn niet enkel belangrijk voor inbraak situaties, maar ook voor als er wat gebeurt met pati\u00ebnten,\u201d vertelt Edward. Hij beheert de camera\u2019s zelf via het dashboard: \u201cDe kwaliteit van de beelden is zeer goed en het dashboard is ook heel gebruiksvriendelijk om beelden te gaan bekijken. Dat zit goed in mekaar!\u201d\nDe camera\u2019s hebben hun nut intussen al bewezen want deze zomer kreeg het centrum op een zaterdag te maken met een ongewenste bezoeker. Deze persoon probeerde dingen mee te nemen, wat uiteindelijk niet gelukt was. De politie heeft daarna beelden opgevraagd waarbij ze erg snel in het dashboard konden vinden wie die persoon precies was. De gebruiksvriendelijkheid van functies zoals motion search maakt de zoektocht naar specifieke gebeurtenissen namelijk aanzienlijk korter. Het volstaat om een regio op de beelden te selecteren en elk frame met bewegingen in die regio wordt weergegeven in een overzicht.\nDankzij het gecentraliseerde dashboard van Meraki functioneert het netwerk van TRAINM beter dan ooit, voornamelijk nu alle elementen in de praktijk met elkaar ge\u00efntegreerd zijn. \u201cDankzij Cisco Meraki zijn alle problemen die we initieel hadden eindelijk opgelost,\u201d vat Edward samen."

Established in 2012, Grab offers a wide portfolio of transportation solutions, ranging from a network of taxis (GrabTaxi) to a private car solution (GrabCar) to a two-wheeled solution to beat the traffic (GrabBike).\nNow spread across 40 cities in 7 countries across Southeast Asia (as of April 2017), Grab is expanding rapidly around the region, to enable users and drivers with its mobile application to provide a seamless experience for moving people from one place to another. Regional IT Networks Manager Kevin Lam is responsible for building and managing the Grab corporate network for thousands of users who work at and visit Grab offices across Asia everyday.\nLam joined Grab as the first and only Network Manager and was tasked by his management team to lead the project to upgrade the Grab network. During its early days as a start-up, Grab had consumer-grade equipment across its network. With Grab continuing its rapid growth, Lam knew that he needed to look at enterprise-grade networking solutions since the consumer-grade network \u201chad been causing connectivity problems, causing failure points, and most importantly, was not scalable.\u201d\nLam heard about Meraki during its early days, back when the Meraki founders started the company out of MIT in 2006. Back in 2006, he admitted that he \u201claughed\u201d at Meraki as he thought it was a fanciful cloud-based solution \u2014 every other solution in the market was a traditional controller-based AP. Fast forward 10 years, he confirms that he doesn\u2019t laugh at the solution anymore. Lam understands the power of the cloud and is now a Meraki convert. \u201cI have now realised that cloud managed IT is the way of the future, and now I cannot imagine Grab without it,\u201d Lam commented.\nShortly after joining Grab, Lam decided to evaluate the Meraki MR32 access points and MX100 security appliance through the Meraki Trial Program, alongside two other networking vendors, for their Malaysia office deployment. Lam had experience with the other vendors\u2019 firewall from his previous roles, and knew all about the traditional solution. You would login using CLI, create interfaces by hand, and set up all the policies manually, which in total takes a few hours. Lam trialled the MX100 side-by-side with the other solution and \u201cnever having used Meraki before, the MX100 was up and running in 10 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat speed was never achievable with the other vendor\u2019s firewall, even with a skilled certified network operator behind the wheel.\u201d\nWith the Meraki dashboard, he was able to log in, configure, and manage the MR32 wireless solution and the MX100 security appliance without the need of CLI. Convinced that this was the way of the future, Lam decided to go ahead with the Meraki solution for their Malaysia office.\nFor their first Meraki deployment, Lam ordered 12 MR32s and 2 MX100s for the Malaysia office. Lam remembers this network refresh: he decided to deploy the Meraki wireless and security solution together with on-premise, non-Meraki switches. After experiencing the ability to manage his wireless and security for the Kuala Lumpur office using the single-pane-of-glass Meraki dashboard from his office in Singapore, Lam was encouraged to try out the cloud managed Meraki MS220 switches.\nLam was initially unconvinced, as he thought the MS220 was the same as any Layer 2 switch in the market. But once he understood there was a full integration with the Meraki MS switches and the Meraki dashboard, this was \u201cthe decider and I was sold on the Meraki MS switches.\u201d Thanks to the ability of the Meraki switches to clone switch configurations and to duplicate port configurations, Lam has replaced all his non-Meraki switches at Grab and now has 98 MS-series switches, in addition to a few hundred MR wireless access points and MX security appliances all over the entire Grab network across 6 countries.\nMeraki works very similar to Grab\u2019s former tagline, \u2018I like it fast\u2019, because my team is able to deploy Meraki at lightning speed\n\nRegional IT Networks Manager\nLam was attracted to the cloud controller because it eliminated the need to build a network management system, which saved Grab months of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars. \u201cThe cloud just makes the network so much easier to manage,\u201d he added. He sees that both Grab and Meraki are \u201cchildren of the cloud,\u201d Grab being a ride-hailing service that relies on cloud-based technology, and Meraki a service that is powered by the cloud. Both harness the power of the cloud to enable centralised control at scale and speed.\nLam has general level-1 IT technicians across the different Grab regional offices (around 2-3 in each office), but he is currently only network specialist at the company. Being the only Network Manager at Grab, having a Meraki cloud-based network goes a long way in helping Lam, a one-man networking operation, manage 35 sites. With the simplicity of deploying Meraki and pushing configurations through the cloud, all that Lam needs from his level-1 IT technicians is to get the Meraki devices online, plug the devices into the correct ports (per his written instructions), set the static IPs, and then it is all good to go. \u201cThis is an example of great automation since we can plan and manage the whole pre-deployment process from our HQ in Singapore. Lean IT, is what people call it.\u201d Lam mentioned.\nThe speed to deployment was crucial for Lam and Grab. In his previous role at a multinational company using non-Meraki devices, it took him more than 6 months to set up the network of a new site. With the cloud-based solution, Lam has experienced how easy and quick it is to deploy his network. For new site deployments, Grab typically racks a couple MX100s, a few MS220s, and a dozen MR42 or MR52s, depending on the density of the sites. With Meraki, the Grab IT team was able to rack all of the hardware in one day and got the network up and running within 24 hours.\nReflecting on the speed of deploying with Meraki, Lam mentioned that \u201ceven pre-scripted, cut-and-paste CLI on legacy systems cannot beat the speed of deployment of Meraki using its dashboard.\u201d For him, to be able to reduce the deployment time for a whole network from 6 months to one day with Meraki is a game-changer. \u201cMeraki works very similar to Grab\u2019s former tagline, \u2018I like it fast\u2019, because my team is able to deploy Meraki at lighting speed,\u201d Lam said. \u201cGrab and I cannot imagine going back to the old ways of managing their IT networks \u2014Meraki is the only way to go.\u201d\n\nPrior to Meraki, Grab employees said their wireless experience was \u201cintolerable\u201d and \u201cnothing was working,\u201d thanks to their consumer-grade network. After Meraki was deployed, the IT team were seen as \u201cconquering heroes\u201d by the Grab employees because the WiFi worked, the internet was seamless, and the networking experience was perfect.\nLam refers to the \u201cspeed and simplicity\u201d of the Meraki deployment and IT management experience as \u201cunbeatable\u201d. Today, Lam utilises the analytics component of Meraki to ensure the best wireless experience for his employees. Using Layer Layer 7 traffic shaping, he ensures that his employees have the bandwidth for business-critical applications while managing the usage of non-critical applications.\nWhen Meraki released its MV cloud managed security cameras, Lam immediately asked his Meraki rep for a trial of the Meraki MV21. He was able to manage the MV security cameras at Grab using the same Meraki dashboard, allowing the Grab physical team to view and analyse footage from all their offices from their HQ in Singapore. The motion-search feature saves the physical security team hours of time spent reviewing footage. Now the team is able to search for any movement, in any specific area of the footage, and in any given space of time almost instantaneously. Lam added that the installation of the MV21 brings the \u201csimplicity and beauty of the cloud to security cameras\u201d, all without the security compromises of the other CCTV vendors.\nLam reflected on how the vision of Meraki is similar to the vision of Grab. Lam noted that \u201cMeraki is the \u2018disruptive future of networking\u2019, similar to how Grab is disrupting the transport industry and how people move from one place to another.\u201d"

    "text": "With breathtaking sunsets and clear blue waters, Phuket is one of Asia\u2019s most popular holiday destinations with over 10 million tourists a year. Nestled in southern Thailand, it is home to palm-lined beaches and superb hospitality. Chalermluck Kebsup, the Mayor of Patong City, Phuket, saw a need to improve tourism services, such as enhancing the transportation network and bettering the tourist experience around Phuket. This led the government to pioneer the idea of initiating a smart city project for Phuket. \u201cWe want the smart city project to improve the quality of life for locals and tourists, improve emergency services, and provide real-time transport and traffic data,\u201d mentioned Mayor Chalermluck.\nThe Government of Phuket identified that providing public WiFi was the first step to improving services and amenities for locals and tourists. In partnership with the Thailand Ministry of Communication, Mayor Chalermluck was tasked with providing a reliable and easy to use public WiFi solution.\nTourists and local businesses in Phuket have voiced the need for consistent city WiFi coverage \u2014 tourists want WiFi to get around and find the best spots in the city, while local businesses want to increase their online footprint with photos and customer reviews. \u201cThere have been multiple companies to offer public WiFi in Phuket, but they have had limited success due to inconsistent coverage and poor user experience,\u201d said Mayor Chalermluck. Based on the poor experience that the government had with these other companies, the government identified the challenges they needed to overcome for success \u2014 a solution to tackle high-density areas, continued connectivity, and a seamless user experience. The government wanted a solution with excellent wireless performance, a great user experience for end users, and simplified management for the IT team.\nTo help install, deploy, and manage the wireless network, Mayor Chalermluck and the Government of Thailand needed a reliable telecommunications provider that was able to execute the public WiFi project. The Government chose CAT Telecom, one of Thailand\u2019s largest networks with a reliable infrastructure that reaches most of the country. Dr. Surapant Meknavin, a Director at CAT Telecom, headed up the team to find the most suitable wireless vendor for Phuket.\nDr. Surapant was introduced to Meraki by their channel partner during the joint participation in the assessment of cloud managed wireless system by the Government of Phuket and CAT Telecom assess cloud managed wireless vendors. Outdoor wireless was chosen to address the requirement, and with the features like high density wireless and seamless connectivity around the city convinced Mayor Chalermluck, Dr.Surapant, and the team to choose the Meraki MR84 for the city-wide deployment.\nThe Meraki MR84s had the right feature set, including high performance deployment with 802.11ac for open-air coverage, but the web-based dashboard was the major drawcard. \u201cThe ability to manage all of these access points from one dashboard will allow for easier management of the network,\u201d said Dr. Surapant.\n\u201cThere were two main considerations for choosing a wireless solution. One of the considerations was to look for a solution that is easy to deploy, and Meraki fit that requirement,\u201d mentioned Dr. Surapant. \u201cHowever, the most important factor was whether this solution was able to create a sustainable business model for wireless around Phuket.\u201d\nEase of deployment\nPhuket has limited technology infrastructure, so it was crucial to Dr. Surapant that they chose a wireless solution that was easy to deploy. With Meraki, \u201cthe team can complete the configurations via the web-based Meraki dashboard,\u201d said Dr. Surapant. This allowed the CAT Telecom team to simply mount the Meraki wireless access points around the city centre and the beaches, plug them in, and the APs downloaded the configurations automatically from the cloud. \u201cThe team can immediately check on the Meraki dashboard to see whether the WiFi is working. This has saved a significant amount of time and cost for the deployment throughout the city,\u201d added Dr. Surapant.\nSustainable business model\nThe Government of Thailand instructed and funded CAT Telecom to find, install, deploy, and manage the wireless solution, but \u201cthere was only initial budget to install and deploy this wireless solution and minimal budget to maintain the network,\u201d Mayor Chalermluck. Keen to ensure that the city WiFi be a continuing service to the city, Mayor Chalermluck, Dr. Surapant, and the team needed to find a sustainable business model.\n\u201cWe worked with our partners and they showed us a location-based business model which leverages an advertising model for tourists, powered by Meraki wireless solutions,\u201d explained Dr. Surapant. \u201cWith this model, we would offer tourists and locals a seamless login to the free city WiFi and provide location-based and personalised advertisements based on each user\u2019s profile.\u201d To achieve an intuitive and seamless WiFi signup process, Meraki with its channel partner\u2019s solutions, Turnstyle and SpotAnalytics, is able to provide an external captive portal to allow users to roam throughout the city without having to re-authenticate at every access point.\nPhuket is able to get deeper visibility into its clients with the analytics provided by the Meraki dashboard. \u201cFeatures including the built-in heat-map and client analytics on the cloud-based dashboard are perfect for our needs,\u201d noted Mayor Chalermluck.\nWith this advertising model in place, along with the partnership with global media agencies, CAT Telecom and Phuket have access to advertising to provide tourists and businesses with an enhanced experience, while providing the revenue that is crucial for a sustainable business model to the maintain of the city WiFi project for the future.\nTo be able to deploy 120 APs across the city and have it working in 5 days is an impressive effort \u2013 such an express installation with Meraki.\n\n\nOnce the decision was made to deploy Meraki throughout Phuket, Dr. Surapant noted that \u201cit took 3 months of site planning, but the installation happened quickly.\u201d The team deployed and mounted 120 Meraki MR84 APs in less than a week.\nDr. Surapant remembered how quickly everything moved. Just six days after the Meraki APs arrived in Thailand, Phuket had a kick-off event for the Government to announce the Phuket SmartCity WiFi project. \u201cThankfully, the Government and CAT Telecom had chosen Meraki, a wireless solution that was so fast to deploy,\u201d remarked Mayor Chalermluck.\nThe team managed to install and deploy 120 Meraki MR84s throughout the city centre and the beach in just five days, in time for the kick-off event. \u201cTo be able to deploy 120 APs across the city and have it working in 5 days is an impressive effort \u2013 such an express installation with Meraki,\u201d mentioned Dr. Surapant.\nInstead of having to send people around the city to update configurations of these access points, the team can easily manage the web-based dashboard from the office. \u201cWith Meraki, not much has to be done for network management. There is almost no need to manage because it has very few errors,\u201d said Dr. Surapant.\nWith Meraki, the Government of Phuket is able to offer better amenities for the city, including free WiFi access for locals, tourists, and businesses alike. \u201cProviding city WiFi has allowed our tourists to explore the best dining and entertainment options around the city. All they need to do is connect to the Meraki SSID we created (\u2018!@SmartCityFreeWiFibyCAT\u2019) and they can enjoy their holiday while being connected,\u201d said Mayor Chalermluck. \u201cIt has also allowed local businesses to tap into online exposure and increase their revenue.\u201d\nThe analytics provided by Meraki and its partners add insights for the local community and businesses. This has paved the way for local businesses to create loyalty programs, advertising, and incentives for customers, leading to higher retention rates. With a new and improved technology infrastructure that allows for mobility, Phuket is now poised to attract more foreign business and employ more local talent.\nThe aim for Phuket is to be the first smart city of Thailand, and the potential of the Phuket smart city project is endless. \u201cWireless with Meraki is the first step towards unlocking this massive project,\u201d added Dr. Surapant."

    "text": "Goodwill Industries, a non-profit organization, owns stores all over the nation focused on training, employing, and transitioning individuals with disabilities into productive and stable employment. The stores are well recognized retail shops stocked with affordable donated goods, and each community operates independently. Goodwill Industries of South Florida consists of 46 stores, up to 3,200 guests and employees, and has over 500 connected devices in its stores at a given time.\nSamuel Robinson is the IT Manager for Goodwill Industries of South Florida and has essentially been a one-man IT team for over 20 years. In that time, he\u2019s only had 6 other technicians and a secretary at various times working with him in total. Today, Robinson and one other technician oversee all audio, video, voice, and networking for the South Florida area and remote users in other states.\n\nPrior to Meraki, none of the Goodwill Industries of South Florida stores had any wireless. \u201cFor the last 20 years, I just haven\u2019t trusted wireless systems enough to set them up,\u201d explained Robinson. He wanted visibility and control of the whole network across stores and employee offices, but couldn\u2019t find a solution that worked for him.\nAs a result, network management was done manually, from software integrations to hardware installation. Basic security software would take a long time to install, requiring complex rules for seemingly simple implementations. In-store hardware installations and troubleshooting was usually done manually, from plugging in cables to testing ports. Most of these processes would require outsourced help, which was not only costly but also time-consuming for a single person.\nRobinson described his management style with the legacy network as \u201creactive,\u201d always having to rely on store managers to contact IT if a network ever had a problem or went down. And when he would hear of a problem, he had minimal insight into what the root source was. \u201cIt would always take a while to get rules corrected, everything tested, and implemented,\u201d explained Robinson. \u201cI had very little visibility and needed an additional license for everything. With Meraki, a lot of that visibility is included.\u201d\n\nFor such a small IT team, Robinson knew that he would want a solution that was easy to deploy and to manage. With the Meraki dashboard, a web-based interface, Robinson is able to monitor, troubleshoot, and configure his entire network from any location. \u201cWhen comparing companies and vendor solutions, the whole evaluation was based off of how much visibility I had,\u201d explained Robinson.\nAbsolute visibility and easy monitoring of the entire network.\nWhen considering new solutions, the first objective was aimed at increasing insight and visibility into employee usage on the network, which the previous system lacked. And with the Meraki dashboard, Robinson now has access to employee usage data that helps him know more about what is happening on the network. With just a few clicks, Robinson now has access to employee usage data including details on applications and http content. This came in handy when he once noticed that over 50% of the bandwidth at a store was being consumed by one device, something he wouldn\u2019t have been able to see with the previous network solution. In the past, store owners would just unplug devices and plug them back in in an attempt to resolve bandwidth issues. Now with Meraki, Robinson is not only able to identify the device and where it is located, but also reroute the traffic so that it doesn\u2019t hog bandwidth anymore.\nAnother aspect of Meraki that Robinson appreciates is the visibility into specific device models that are connected to the network, such as computers, DVRs, media devices, cell phones, and more. Before, he would have had to manually count each device on the network to know what was where. And some solutions, like DVR systems, would require manual reboots, which meant someone on-site would have to facilitate that. Now he can just look at the dashboard, review the usage and application summaries, and manage the network from his own location.\nFor Robinson, who was skeptical about implementing wireless for 20 years, all that he could see and do with Meraki changed his mindset completely. \u201cWhen I saw the visibility I could have, I decided to give Meraki a chance.\u201d\nA robust networking solution that enables Goodwill to be more informed and proactive.\nFor full visibility and control over the network, Goodwill takes advantage of MX security appliances, MS switches, and MR wireless access points \u2013 the Meraki full stack \u2013 in every store. With the full suite of products visible in the dashboard, Robinson can troubleshoot and configure devices all through a single interface. Now the tool that\u2019s used to shut down ports and assign VLANs is the same one used for traffic shaping and security policies. This contributes greatly to Robinson\u2019s day to-day management and enables him to be more proactive with the network.\nFor any type of event, Robinson set up email alerts so that he can always be the first one to know if something goes wrong with the network. \u201cI have alerts for specific events that all go to the top of my inbox,\u201d as Robinson puts it, \u201cand I prefer it that way.\u201d That means from wired to wireless, each store is monitored very closely, even if it is just by one person.\nRobinson is able to architect the optimal system for each store environment and increase what Goodwill knows about guest and visitor activity. One store can see up to 439 connected visitors, so adding firewall protection guards Goodwill\u2019s main network from potential security breaches. And since all Meraki solutions enable customers to enforce a PCI compliant network, an important capability for Goodwill, Robinson could ensure their network infrastructure adhered to PCI Data Security Standards for managing and protecting cardholder data.\nA comprehensive suite of products that is also cost-effective.\nAt first, the upfront equipment cost appeared to be a major deterrent for Robinson, but when he considered the amount of time he would save, in addition to the licensing structure, the decision to go with Meraki was much easier. In fact, according to Robinson, \u201cWe decided to go with Meraki primarily because of the way the licensing structure was built.\u201d\nThe previous networking solutions were license-based as well, but required various licensing components that all solved the same problems. With Meraki, \u201ceverything is included. I have intrusion protection, better visibility across my wireless and switching, and continuous firmware updates\u201d all wrapped into a simple license structure. Included with every Meraki solution is 24/7 Meraki support, however, Robinson works very closely with their partner, SOUTEC, for any of their technical needs.\nFind out more about Goodwill\u2019s in-store deployment and partnership with SOUTEC here.\n\nNow that Goodwill has built out and standardized its networking solutions, Robinson is focused on advancing store mobility and analytics features. The next step for Goodwill is to focus on mobile devices and security. They have begun testing and exploring Cisco\u2019s enterprise mobility management solution, Meraki Systems Manager (SM). With it, Robinson can have better control of tablets and other devices that employees use throughout the stores and to manage and log donations. With SM, Goodwill can enforce device security policies, deploy software and applications, and guarantee that devices are only used for business needs.\nFor Robinson, Meraki has helped make managing, troubleshooting, and configuring the network much easier to do across a vast network. Since it is only him and another person, they must always be available, anything could happen at any time. Yet, Meraki has still managed to open up time and energy for them to do more planning and work on important projects. \u201cEverything always comes to me eventually,\u201d explained Robinson, \u201cNow I\u2019m able to look at things differently and from a long term perspective, be more proactive, be less reactive. Meraki buys me that time and allows me to work remotely from home in Cartagena, Colombia more often.\u201d"

    "text": "The MacArtney Group are experts in underwater technology solutions. Since its founding in 1978, the Danish company has been supplying these solutions to operators and developers within industries like oil & gas, renewable energy, civil engineering, ocean science, and fisheries. Everything their customers purchase, from cameras to remote-controlled robots, is custom-made.\nJacob R\u00f8nberg, MacArtney\u2019s IT Administration Manager, looks after the network of 17 offices in 11 countries. With help from two other colleagues, also based at the Danish HQ, he supports the needs of 450 employees in offices from San Diego to Singapore. Until a few years ago, managing a very diverse and complicated network was quite a headache for the IT team. The myriad of different products from different vendors made it a hassle to troubleshoot and to guarantee proper network security.\nJacob had been following Meraki since its founding in 2006, so when it was time to update MacArtney\u2019s network, he was very keen on comparing the Meraki cloud-managed solution with a few other vendors. A lean IT team with so many different locations to manage needed a secure, stable, and simple solution.\nWhat I love about Meraki is the manageability. If three people have to manage a network all around the world, it needs to be simple because we just don\u2019t have enough time.\n\nIT Administration Manager\nOnce the decision was made, Jacob\u2019s team started ordering Meraki MX security appliances. As they renewed each site, they also gradually implemented MS225 switches and MR33 access points. When the order was placed, the team immediately got an order number which allowed them to configure the devices before they even arrived. With products from other vendors, Jacob would have gone on site, but with Meraki it\u2019s as close to plug-and-play as it can get. It\u2019s so simple that when MacArtney recently changed their Internet service provider in Norway, an employee reconfigured the firewall during half of his lunch break.\nMacArtney\u2019s network is configured in a mesh topology, routing traffic to VPN tunnels. Aside from manageability, security is a number one priority for the company, which is where the MX security appliances come in handy. Features like Security Centre offer the ability to intervene both reactively and proactively in response to threats. It even contains a retroactive feature which prompts an alert if someone downloaded a virus several days ago.\nOn the switch level there are multiple features Jacob hadn\u2019t even thought about before. The fact that he can simply select a switch port and have granular visibility saves him a lot of time and effort. Cable testing from anywhere in the world and Layer 3 routing are other examples of how Meraki\u2019s switches can do more. \u201cMost people consider the firewall as the core of the network, but if you want to optimize for speed and efficiency you need to set up the switch for routing and not the firewall. There are so many features on the switch that I like and, thanks to Meraki, it becomes the brain of your network.\u201d\nFor wireless access to the network Jacob\u2019s team has set up 2 SSIDs. One of them is used as a guest network and is set up with SMS platform Twilio. Guests can now just login with their phone number and receive an SMS code to connect securely. Thanks to the smooth API integration there are no more guest codes lying around at MacArtney, creating a more secure, efficient, and positive visitor experience.\nOne of Jacob\u2019s favourite wireless features is the ability to connect SSIDs directly via a VPN tunnel to the office. One of MacArtney\u2019s suppliers often needs help on-site, requiring MacArtney employees to work remotely from their office. By using the Meraki Z1 device they just put a Meraki access point on the supplier\u2019s site with an SSID to create a direct VPN tunnel back to MacArtney\u2019s HQ. On top of that, they don\u2019t even have to mess with the supplier\u2019s network or ask them to make changes.\nSimplicity, security, and stability are the three words Jacob uses to summarize MacArtney\u2019s current network. \u201cI was recently setting up the network in our German office and plugged an access point into a PoE switch. The switch died but the AP kept working, creating a self-healing wireless network\u201d, he mentions. Meraki helps his team work much more efficiently, which saves the company significantly in resources.\nOn a mission to keep improving, Jacob is now also looking into the Meraki MV security cameras to replace older equipment. Adding MV cameras to the network will help Jacob\u2019s team to also manage video surveillance in the Meraki dashboard. Another network element simplified or as Jacob summarizes it:\nI had a lot of \u2018wow-experiences\u2019 with Meraki. It\u2019s one of those brands you just fall in love with\n\nIT Administration Manager"

    "text": "An eCommerce business with various well-known luxury brands as part of their product portfolio, Reebonz Limited aims to create an easy way to buy and sell luxury items. Started in Singapore in 2009, Reebonz offers \u2018accessible luxury\u2019 shopping to its members, who can buy from new and pre-owned luxury merchandise collections.\nAs a rapidly growing business with more than 250 employees across 8 countries, Torres Oey, Chief Technology Officer, recognises that leading technology is the backbone to support the fulfilment and operations-intensive requirements of the business. With the Cisco Meraki full stack, comprised of MR access points, MS switches, and MX security appliances, Torres is able to ensure the rapid expansion of Reebonz with a robust and secure network across their corporate offices and warehouse facilities.\n\nThe previous networking solution used a mix of vendors, making it difficult for the Reebonz IT team to manage the network effectively across their distributed sites. With just two members on the IT team, Torres needed a solution that provided a better network management experience for his lean team.\n\nWhile looking for an improved next generation firewall, Torres was introduced to Meraki through Reebonz\u2019s channel partners as a solution that could improve their existing security solution. In particular, Reebonz was looking for a solution with intrusion prevention system and intrusion detection system (amongst other things), so the Meraki MX security appliance was recommended to them as a solution.\nIn addition, given the rapid expansion to new countries, Torres wanted the new solution to allow his team simplified maintenance of their network. Using Meraki, Torres discovered the possibility of having their network managed through the cloud and how easy network management could be. It was \u201cthe ease of maintenance of Meraki that was a big factor\u201d in their decision-making process, said Torres.\n\u201cI chose Meraki because I was able manage my whole network on one single product,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWith Meraki, I can practically map out my network floor-by-floor, switch-by-switch, as well as all the access points on all the different floors of the office and the warehouse.\u201d\nI chose Meraki because I was able manage my whole network on one single product\n\nChief Technology Officer.\nThe deployment planning process took the longest time, with almost four months dedicated to network planning, including laying out the cables through the office and the warehouses. Once the deployment plan was finalised and all the cables laid out, Reebonz and his channel partners deployed the MX100 security appliances as the United Threat Management device and the MS350 switches for Layer 3 switching for both their offices and warehouse. \u201cThe deployment was relatively quick and painless for my team,\u201d mentioned Torres.\nTo provide wireless, Reebonz deployed a combination of MR32 indoor access points for their offices and MR72 outdoor access points for their warehouses based on the projected usage to suit the the fulfilment needs of Reebonz. These access points were deployed by plugging them in via power over ethernet (PoE). \u201cSince the APs were easy to plug in via PoE, this process became really simple and quick,\u201d said Torres.\n\nTorres and his IT team of two can now manage their whole network of offices and warehouses in 8 countries from their headquarters in Singapore with the cloud-based dashboard. \u201cWith Meraki, we can pinpoint at any time which access point is not working, or whether there may be a power failure on a specific floor of the office.\u201d\nAs an example, Torres received a phone call from his operations team over the weekend about how the wireless was not working. \u201cThankfully, I have downloaded the Meraki app on my Android phone. All I needed to do was to check the network and I noticed that all the Meraki wireless APs were online and working \u2014 turns out there was a problem with one of our servers which stopped them from accessing the application server and nothing wrong with the Meraki network.\u201d This has allowed his team to change the way they approach troubleshooting. \u201cInstead of coming into the office every time there is a problem, we can troubleshoot remotely with Meraki, saving the team a lot of time and effort,\u201d added Torres.\nAs part of the future expansion plan of the Reebonz, Meraki will allow Torres to reduce the deployment times for new sites. He can simply clone existing settings and push these configurations from the cloud across the new devices in minutes, saving time and money in the long run."

Under the leadership of its 11th President, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Bowen, the college was recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative colleges by U.S. News & World Report for two consecutive years. Located in Baltimore, Maryland, on a 287-acre campus, Goucher is home to more than 2,000 undergraduates and graduate students and nearly 500 faculty and staff members.\nThe leadership team of Bill Leimbach, Vice President of Technology and Planning, and Greg Howard, Director of Networking/Telecom, realized that Goucher\u2019s innovative vision also needed to appear within the college\u2019s internal structure by upgrading the network technology. In 2014, Leimbach and Howard began looking into networking solutions to fit the college\u2019s requirements for a network refresh. Goucher\u2019s legacy hardware was nearing end-of-life and only provided 1-gigabit uplink capabilities. More bandwidth was imperative to be able to support video teaching and higher level communication platforms, such as VoIP phones and AV systems, throughout the campus. Goucher needed a complete network upgrade to a more robust solution capable of 10G uplinks that could seamlessly integrate with their existing Cisco Nexus core.\nThe cloud-based management of the Meraki solution was a key selling point. As with many colleges with a two-person IT staff managing the network for the entire campus, they needed a solution that was easy to configure, manage, and troubleshoot remotely. After seeing the robust administration and visibility provided by the Meraki dashboard, Goucher made the decision to purchase and deploy more than 730 Meraki wireless access points (APs) and about 70 Meraki access switches.\nMy team is extremely lean, so the cloud based administration and deployment was a big seller.\n\nDirector of Networking and Telecom, Goucher College\nAfter performing a wireless survey, Howard and his team deployed Meraki APs throughout all classrooms and common areas across campus while simultaneously installing the switches in their network closets throughout the campus. Unlike previous deployments, the zero-touch configuration capabilities meant the team could preconfigure hundreds of network devices from one dashboard before ever unboxing them. After providing each AP and switch with a power source and internet connection, each device received its configuration automatically from the cloud. This cut down the time Greg\u2019s team spent deploying the new network. The cloud dashboard also gets rid of error-prone manual configuration and makes sure the network is secure.\nThe MR Access Points provide a reliable wireless connection for students, teachers, and guests alike. Goucher has five different SSIDs set up, including one for students and staff with 802.1X RADIUS authentication as well as an open guest network. Greg and his team take advantage of Layer 3 firewall rules on the APs to allow or deny specific network traffic. The Goucher IT team also uses the maps and floorplans section of the Meraki dashboard to upload blueprints of different campus buildings, which allows them to place APs directly on the map to keep track of their exact location.\nMeraki MS Switches can be found across Goucher\u2019s campus and provide a solid, reliable 10-gig backbone to handle all of the network\u2019s most demanding applications. Centralized management of switches provides control over distributed ports, giving Greg and his team campus-wide visibility of the entire network and the ability to see specific devices and traffic running through each switch port. This provides a powerful new way to ensure the network is secure and performing as expected. Virtual stacking and port tagging capabilities allow specific switches to be grouped in the dashboard by type, location, device, and more. When Goucher\u2019s IT team sees issues in the dashboard or receives a proactive network alert, integrated troubleshooting tools like cloud packet captures and cable tests can be done in seconds, and Meraki 24/7 support is always a quick phone call away.\nAll of the little things that I used to worry about are gone \u2013 now Meraki just does it.\n\nDirector of Networking and Telecom, Goucher College\nFirmware upgrades are automatically downloaded from the cloud and can be scheduled at the team\u2019s convenience. As Howard explains, \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything! I just click this button, set it for 4 a.m., and it\u2019s done! It\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s fantastic!\u201d\nSince their original fall 2014 deployment, Goucher has added about 40 additional APs and 30 new switches to support increased demand for wireless and more devices on the network. New campus buildings will be coming online in the next three years, with each building requiring an additional 40-70 access points and about 4 switches.\nWith the help of Meraki, this simple solution helped Goucher match its innovative vision with modern day technology."

    "text": "What is Cisco Live? Depends on who you ask.\nFor the thousands of network administrators who attend the massive conference every year, Cisco Live is the best place to learn about the latest innovations from the world\u2019s largest networking company. For Cisco\u2019s leadership team, it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to announce partnerships with companies like Apple. And what about for JW McIntire, Program Manager for Cisco Live\u2019s own networking team? \u201cCisco Live is simultaneously the most exciting and the scariest part of my job,\u201d McIntire says.\nBehind the scenes, McIntire is just one of many individuals who worked tirelessly to ensure over 28,000 attendees enjoyed reliable connectivity at Cisco Live! Las Vegas 2017. This team, made up of nearly 50 individuals, included McIntire; Stephen Lynch, a Consulting Systems Engineer at Meraki; and Ryan D\u2019Souza, a Technical Marketing Engineer at Cisco. The challenge they faced was daunting: besides building a robust infrastructure that could deliver and transmit information quickly, the team also had to protect everyone and their devices from network security threats. Plus, it hardly needs to be said that a network meltdown at an event hosted by a networking company would be catastrophic (not to mention deeply ironic).\nAs one would expect, Cisco\u2019s own networking equipment, such as its industry-leading Catalyst switches and ASA FirePower security appliances, have played a critical role in supporting networks at Cisco Live for years. Following Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Meraki a few years prior, Meraki has also helped support the network access layer at Cisco Live events. But it was in 2017 when Meraki truly made its mark at Cisco Live, making its debut in the high-pressure Cisco NOC (Network Operations Center) at the center of the Cisco Campus. \u201cDeploying Meraki equipment at Cisco Live wasn\u2019t about showing off our latest and greatest gear,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cWhat we really wanted to do was prove that Meraki was ready for an incredibly demanding enterprise environment, so we incorporated Meraki right into the backbone of the network.\u201d\nThe Meraki deployment at Cisco Live focused on a few main areas: satellite registration kiosks, the Cisco Campus, and the Cisco Store. A combination of Meraki switches, security cameras, access points, and security appliances was deployed throughout Cisco Live to create a first-class attendee experience.\nThough the actual conference was hosted at the Mandalay Bay hotel, Cisco set registration kiosks up at Luxor and The Cosmopolitan to speed up the registration process for attendees staying at those hotels. Powering each of these kiosks were Meraki MR52 access points, MS220 switches, and an MX64 security appliance. Using Auto VPN, a feature of the MX that automatically provisions a site-to-site VPN connection without tedious configuration, registration info from the kiosks could be securely sent to the central registration server. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually had a similar setup for the satellite registration booths at past Cisco Live events,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThe success we had in 2015 and 2016, at Cisco Live Cancun, really paved the way for a broader deployment of Meraki gear in 2017.\u201d\nThat broader deployment was most evident at the Cisco Campus, the heart and soul of the entire event. For 2017, the Cisco Campus was divided into two separate sections: the World of Solutions and the IoT and Industry District. A pair of stacked Meraki MS425 switches served as the aggregation switch for the main Cisco Campus area; these switches were linked via two 40GB OSPF connections to an upstream Cisco 7000 Series core switch. Connected to the stacked MS425s were a dozen MS350 switches, which in turn were linked to 110 MS220 switches distributed throughout the Cisco Campus to facilitate connectivity of numerous access points and Ethernet-connected devices.\nAdditionally, McIntire and his team created a new logical network for the IoT and Industry District that consisted of five Meraki access points and 32 MS220 switches. These APs and switches were all connected to a high capacity MS350 switch, which was then connected to an MX100 security appliance that tunneled all traffic to an MX400 located at the Cisco Live NOC.\nMeraki also played an integral role in creating a top-notch experience at the DevNet Zone, where developers inside and outside Cisco could network, and at the Cisco Store. Both were located in the World of Solutions area of the Cisco Campus. Meraki MR wireless access points, with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radios, tracked foot traffic in the DevNet zone using attendees\u2019 devices and corroborated this data with the locations of key Cisco experts, who were tracked via BLE-enabled Cisco badges. This allowed the visitors to the DevNet Zone to locate the right expert in real time on a 3D map of the event space. Additionally, Meraki MV security cameras protected the Cisco Store from theft and supplied the footage for a giant video wall displayed live to attendees.\nWhile Cisco could have deployed all of its traditionally managed equipment at Cisco Live, the real value of Meraki \u2014 and the reason why Cisco acquired Meraki in the first place \u2014 was the simplicity that Meraki brought to the table. \u201cAt Cisco Live, what\u2019s truly remarkable is the sheer size and scale of the event,\u201d McIntire commented. \u201cCisco equipment managed on-premises wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as easy to stage and deploy. When you\u2019re talking about such a massive deployment, the time that Meraki saved us was valuable.\u201d\nIn the weeks leading up to Cisco Live, a team of Cisco engineers (including D\u2019Souza, the Technical Marketing Engineer) acquired all of the Meraki equipment and staged it in Building 17 at Cisco headquarters in San Jose, CA. The Meraki dashboard made it quite simple to configure devices in bulk. \u201cOnce we had all the switches online [in the staging environment], I upgraded 130 switches in a couple of clicks, labeled them based on location, and created the VLANs. Normally, you\u2019d have to upgrade the firmware on each switch one by one or use some other software management tool, which would have been a huge pain,\u201d D\u2019Souza said.\nAfter everything was configured according to plan in San Jose, the team shipped the Meraki equipment to Las Vegas. From there, it was simply a plug-and-play affair, since the devices retained their configurations locally. The team setting up all the equipment in Las Vegas \u2014 including Meraki Sales Engineers Alex Burger, Nathan Wiens, and Jeffry Handal \u2014 could use troubleshooting tools right from the dashboard to ensure that all the cables were transferring data correctly. They could even blink LED lights on individual switches to indicate what needed to be plugged into each port. Finally, monitoring tools within the dashboard helped make sure packets were passing through the network correctly both during setup and throughout the event.\nUltimately, McIntire, Lynch, and D\u2019Souza were pretty hands-off during Cisco Live and could concentrate on learning and networking during the conference, a testament to how easy Meraki equipment is to manage. \u201cI came out there post-deployment and was basically an escalation point, in case we ran into any issues,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cFortunately, there wasn\u2019t a single reported problem with any of the Meraki gear for the duration of the event. Alex, Nathan, Jeffry, and the rest of the team ensured that everything went seamlessly.\u201d\nLynch is also proud of how well Meraki performed in such a high pressure environment; 8.6 TB of bandwidth passed through the Cisco Campus network. \u201cIt was a real hybrid environment \u2014 we had tons of Meraki equipment alongside Cisco gear and hardware, including Cisco video surveillance cameras,\u201d McIntire said. \u201cWhen cloud management made sense, going with Meraki was a no-brainer because it eliminated the need for physical controllers as well as NVRs [Network Video Recorders] for the cameras.\u201d\nMeraki technology helped Cisco achieve success in Las Vegas, but Lynch recognized the value Meraki can bring to enterprises everywhere. \u201cMany of the reasons we saw so much success with Meraki at Cisco Live \u2014 like simplicity, high density, and zero-touch deployment \u2014 matter in so many different environments,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cBased on the positive feedback we got at Cisco Live in 2017, I\u2019m confident Meraki will continue to play an important role at future Cisco Live events going forward.\u201d"

    "text": "With well over 15 years of experience in IT, Juan Saldana understands of the importance of a reliable wireless network. Saldana heads up the IT team in Cameron County, Texas, as Chief Technology Officer. His IT team of 12 focuses on managing everything technology related for the county, from day-to-day tasks to larger network overhauls. One of Saldana\u2019s first projects when he joined was to expand the wireless presence to buildings throughout the county. \u201cEveryone wanted wireless but there was no direction,\u201d he explained; only the health department, district attorney, and a single floor in the courthouse were equipped with wireless connectivity. With over 1,600 people in the county and device counts constantly increasing, there was a clear need for wireless.\nSaldana came equipped with previous experience managing Cisco hardware, so when he learned about Meraki, he was intrigued. With a feature-rich and refreshingly easy-to-manage suite of products, as well as a cloud-managed dashboard full of capabilities, choosing Meraki seemed like a no-brainer for him and his team. After participating in a Certified Meraki Networking Operator (CMNO) training, Saldana felt confident that his four-person infrastructure team could support and manage any Meraki gear they encountered\u2013sharing that \u201cno one on the team had experience with working with any wireless product, [but] Meraki took away the intimidation of working with an on-premise solution\u2026With the Meraki interface, it\u2019s a couple clicks and you\u2019re done. And it\u2019s equally secure!\u201d\nCurrently, Meraki MR access points are deployed in the county jail and the Commissioner\u2019s Court, supporting mainly iPhone and Android devices. Saldana and his team are moving into a new six-floor building, which will soon be installing Meraki APs to support around 400 people. Attorneys and people in court can join an open, public network by clicking through a splash page to log in. The IT team has set up traffic-shaping rules to ensure bandwidth equitability, scheduling rule sets to allow access to the public SSID in the courthouse from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, and firewall rules ensure people can access email and the internet. An internal, private network is configured to allow staff access to county resources with the use of a preshared key. In the future, Saldana will be upgrading to 802.1X Active Directory authentication.\nWith the Meraki interface, it\u2019s a couple of clicks and you\u2019re done.\n\nChief Technology Officer\nCameron County\u2019s foray into Meraki doesn\u2019t stop at just access points. Saldana and his team are big fans of Meraki MV security cameras as well. After about a month of testing the cameras, they plan on deploying them in the in the office of the justice of the peace, as well as in the new, aforementioned county building, which will house the IT team.\nFor Saldana and his team, cloud management from a single dashboard has been essential. Gear can be configured in the Meraki dashboard before it\u2019s ever taken out of the box; the dashboard provides visibility into network traffic, which was previously absent; and troubleshooting has been a breeze. When employees in the Commissioner\u2019s Court building told the IT team they couldn\u2019t access the internet, the team checked the dashboard and immediately saw an AP was marked as red\u2014it was down. After doing a simple reboot through the dashboard, the AP was back up and running, and the employees were able to connect\u2014without the IT team even stepping away from their desk.\nFuture plans for the team at Cameron County involve deploying additional Meraki APs and Cameras to the new building. Until then, they\u2019re excited about the connectivity and safety their new APs and cameras bring to Cameron county."

    "text": "For more than 100 years, the Harbin Clinic has been committed to providing innovative patient care in Northwest Georgia. It is the largest privately owned, multi-specialty physician group in the state, comprised of 240 medical professionals representing 40 different medical specialties and services. Today, there are 21 Harbin Clinic practices located across eleven counties.\nWhen Ernest Staats, Senior IT Security and Network Administrator, first joined Harbin Clinic, he realized quickly that their network \u201cwas in need of help.\u201d Their flat Layer 2 network continuously dropped data packets and lost connections since it could not manage a high volume of traffic. Harbin\u2019s 1GB dark fiber network had reached its limit. It was difficult for the team to troubleshoot given the lack of visibility into the network. The IT team could not even see what was plugged into their switches.\nWhen issues came up with machines that vendors like McKesson and GE operated on Harbin\u2019s network, the vendor support teams had a difficult time solving issues due to Harbin\u2019s network. As a result, most IT problems took a long time to fix or remained unsolved. On Staats\u2019 first day he was asked to solve Harbin\u2019s guest WiFi problem. He replied that he would be able to fix the problem quickly \u2014 if they had Meraki.\nPrior to working with Harbin Clinic, Staats deployed Meraki in dozens of schools as part of his security and network consulting business. He found that Meraki was easy to implement at schools in a short period of time and did not require a large IT staff to handle. His only challenge at Harbin Clinic was convincing a skeptical team that they should try Meraki instead of keeping a traditional on-premises vendor. Once Staats showed his team how the Meraki switches work, they chose Meraki.\nStaats\u2019 team needed to replace 178 traditional switches with Meraki switches in 24 buildings over a 100 mile radius. As a part of this project, they also had to re-cable, set up a Layer 3 network, and switch their entire Layer 2 network to Layer 3. They were only allowed to work on this project on nights and weekends so they would not impact patient care. Additionally, they needed to correlate their schedules with the schedules of the vendors since they were re IP-ing the entire network. In some of the larger three- to four-story buildings, they had to meet with as many as fourteen vendors on-site.\nTo implement Meraki, they would pre-stage a building, get the network ready, and plan what the IP scheme was going to be ahead of traveling to the site. Staats\u2019 team lined up hundreds to thousands of pieces of equipment in each building and made sure that the vendors for the different types of equipment were ready to change their IP addresses. They would then pre-stage the equipment and get the IP addresses set up.\nWith Meraki, the Harbin Clinic has the ability to clone configurations through the template feature. As a result, for each of the subsequent 24 buildings they were able to change the switches within hours rather than days or weeks.\nDuring the process, the team discovered at least 200 medical devices located in their buildings that they did not even know that they had. Staats\u2019 team now tracks all of these devices through the Meraki MDM dashboard.\nAfter implementing Meraki, Staats\u2019 team noticed immediate benefits. The dashboard\u2019s search ability allowed them to quickly find and contain network issues. When troubleshooting, the team started performing packet captures on individual ports, which allowed them to monitor their traffic. Most importantly, they have been able to use Meraki switches to contain ransomware and solve security issues.\nOne security instance stands out in particular. Staats\u2019 team received an email from Sword & Shield, their managed security information and event management (SIEM) provider, indicating a workstation within Harbin Clinic\u2019s network had been compromised by ransomware and that its IP was reaching out to external, malicious CnC sources. In response to Sword & Shield\u2019s email, the Harbin network/security team looked at the affected IP address and determined it was in the Cancer Center based on the newly developed \u201cper-building\u201d IP scheme. After identifying the location, the team was then able to leverage the Meraki dashboard to determine which workstation was assigned this IP address, and which switch port it was attached to. They disabled the port before the ransomware propagated itself further into the network infrastructure, where it would have inevitably caused more damage. The time from the alert to the time the port was shut down was less than five minutes.\nToday, Harbin uses Meraki MS switches, MX security, MR access points, and MV cameras. New team members are trained on Meraki within 20 minutes. Some team members joke that Meraki\u2019s mobile app is their version of Facebook because they like seeing how much data is being used and what\u2019s happening with their network. Vendors no longer blame equipment issues on Harbin\u2019s network and, as a result, Staats\u2019 team is able to solve equipment issues.\nWhen the Harbin team has questions about Meraki, they utilize Meraki support.\nThe Meraki tech support are rockstars. The tech support is #1\n\nSenior IT Security and Network Administrator\nAfter implementing Meraki, his team transitioned from chasing fires to working on security projects with their extra time.\nMoving forward, their goals are to increase visibility through more logging and correlation with their security information and event management (SIEM). This will help them gain more information about their users.\nAdditionally, the Harbin team plans on implementing more Meraki MV cameras in remote datacenters. Staats categorized the cameras as \u201ca set it and forget it technology.\u201d It takes his team just five minutes to get each camera up and running, and they are able to access the video in the Meraki dashboard from any location. This makes it easy to delegate users and assign different permissions to each camera.\nStaats has the following advice for people considering Meraki: \u201cTry it out! Always come in with an open mind and I think you will be surprised with the results you get.\u201d"

    "text": "Socorro Independent School District is located in the El Paso region of West Texas, close to the border of New Mexico. The district is comprised of 47 schools serving more than 46,100 students. As a high-performing K-12 district, Socorro ISD\u2019s focus has always been on student access and achievement. Even though areas of the district house low-income families, the school\u2019s leadership is concentrated on providing all of its learners with the same tools as a more affluent district. Socorro ISD began to focus on 21st Century Learning (C21), a program that enforces core competencies (such as collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking and problem solving) to help students thrive in today\u2019s digital world. In order to accommodate a C21 instructional model, the school district needed a more robust, flexible, and scalable technology network. Socorro ISD relied on wireless, but the aging access points (APs) in its classrooms did not meet the district\u2019s expectations. \u201cAbout five years ago, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Espinoza, Socorro ISD\u2019s superintendent, led the development of our future-ready initiative and committed to curriculum changes and providing devices and laptops to students,\u201d says Chief Technology Officer Hector Reyna of Socorro ISD. \u201cThese investments proved crucial to the innovative \u2018WIN Academy,\u2019 which Dr. Espinoza introduced to support at-risk youth and students from low-income families to ensure they had the best access to a brighter future.\u201d The WIN Academy was created to bring groups of learners together for three years across the district\u2019s elementary schools, with one class of learners in the academy at each grade level. In addition, the district also hoped to grant each student a digital device. \u201cOur goal at that point was the same most promising and essential educational programs within our district,\u201d says Reyna. Since Socorro desired a stronger digital curriculum across its schools and needed to prepare for the WIN Academy, its leaders decided to reinvest in the district\u2019s infrastructure to support Internet access and mobile learning. In addition to new types of personalized learning, the district also wanted to keep schools open after hours to promote out-of-class learning.\nOur goal [is] to make sure we have a solid infrastructure in place to support the most promising and essential educational programs within our district.\n\nChief Technology Officer\nAn infrastructure upgrade was essential to building new educational programs, so Socorro ISD used E-rate funding and local sources of revenue to help meet its technological needs. Socorro ISD is divided into two areas that encompass a diverse demographic. As a 71-percent free and reduced lunch district, Socorro ISD is eligible for significant E-rate discounts, including those for Internet access and telecommunications services under E-rate Category One and discounts on cabling and switching under E-rate Category Two. As such, the school district\u2019s E-rate Administrator Tricia Dominquez worked with the IT team to put together a compelling plan to leverage Category Two funding for the needed technologies at each campus. Chief areas of concern within the plan were price, reliability, value, scalability, and service. \u201cSocorro ISD is a passionate district, one that cares deeply about the role it plays in a child\u2019s education,\u201d says Reyna. \u201cWith this upgrade we needed to make sure that every child on campus had access to the Internet on demand with no questions asked.\u201d Reyna and Ben Ross, network director at Socorro ISD, issued an RFP for new network solutions. Within the RFP, the priority was connecting the right solutions with the right price. In 2013, Reyna and Ross began reviewing vendors and evaluating competitive solutions. During the review process, Cisco stood out among the other solutions\u2014the company was a major player in West Texas and showed a strong ability to meet all of the goals laid out in the RFP. Since Cisco\u2019s network came with a reputation of reliability, Reyna and Ross decided to pilot some wireless solutions and quickly found that Cisco was easy to maneuver and competitively priced. \u201cIn 2013 our first deployment target was our high schools, and we wanted to hit the ground running,\u201d says Reyna. \u201cWe needed to provide robust wireless to these campuses at least 10 hours out of every day, without the need for excessive professional development.\nAfter the testing period, Socorro ISD decided to purchase Cisco Meraki\u2014which offers a complete cloud-managed wireless network that\u2019s built to simplify the challenges of modern, device-centric networks. \u201cFollowing our testing, we knew Cisco Meraki would be easy to teach to our instructors, and the claims behind the technology lived up to its performance\u2014both on the power side and the support side.\u201d As Socorro ISD began to deploy more than 2000 Cisco Meraki APs in the district\u2019s high schools, Cisco made sure an engineer from the company was on-site at all times to support the transition. Overall, the deployment timeline was one year, ensuring that by the 2014-2015 school year, Socorro ISD was ready to reach its students with a new wireless network intact. \u201cOne year may seem like an extended deployment, but it was critical for our team to spend time troubleshooting and reallocating, especially in such a large district,\u201d says Reyna. \u201cWe wanted to launch a high-functioning, top-of-the-line network to match the potential of our students.\u201d Once the school year was underway, Socorro ISD and Reyna also decided to invest in Cisco Catalyst Switching to bolster the school\u2019s new 10-gigabyte network.\nFollowing our testing, we knew Cisco Meraki would be easy to teach to our instructors, and the claims behind the technology lived up to its performance.\n\nChief Technology Officer\nSince the deployment of Cisco Meraki Access Points and Cisco Catalyst Switching, Socorro ISD has experienced large gains in performance\u2014both technically and academically. In terms of digital curriculum, Socorro ISD is now at the forefront of schools in the nation. Each instructor develops lessons online daily, and students can follow this curriculum page-by-page on mobile devices\u2014a feat that would not be possible without a reliable wireless infrastructure with consistent uptime. \u201cWhen we look at our teachers and our students, we see that engagement is better, attendance is higher, and discipline is down on nearly every campus,\u201d says Reyna. \u201cThese types of gains, and the ability to implement new programs that take our students in new directions, are thanks in large part to our new wireless environment.\u201d One of the main reasons Socorro ISD has experienced such success is due to the vision of district Superintendent Jos\u00e9 Espinoza to treat and educate each student as if they were his own. Espinoza campaigned for more funds to be poured into technology so that all students would have equal access to technology, regardless of their campus or personal situation. As a result, Socorro ISD students are confident that they get an equal, even superior, global education. \u201cWe really want every child to have access to everything they deserve, especially our lower-income students,\u201d says Reyna. \u201cWe want our students to be well prepared for a global economy, and we want them to launch into a range of diverse industries; that\u2019s why C21 skills are so critical, and wireless is the backbone for that type of learning.\u201d\nSpecifically, Socorro ISD has experienced better wireless coverage in all schools with new APs. Cisco Meraki provides the district with access to resources that students might not have otherwise, as well as easy troubleshooting, constant uptime, zero touch provisioning and future-proof technology. The new accessibility for students and increased bandwidth also provide more learning opportunities during off-peak hours. The surrounding community is even able to connect at local parks, ensuring that school resources are available on the playground if needed. Thanks to its new wireless environment, Socorro ISD was also able to stand up the WIN Academy, which expanded to 16 campuses in 2016. The data that evaluates both low-income and at-risk students within this program has shown major gains, which is supported by the network. Lastly, Socorro ISD launched a one-to-one (1:1) learning environment thanks to its new network. A 1:1 environment is established when a school issues each specified student an electronic device that they may use to access the Internet, digital course materials and digital textbooks. With its new 1:1 environment, the district is able to provide a laptop to every matriculating freshman to prepare them for a digitally-intensive curriculum; 2016 is the third year of this program.\nMoving into 2017, Socorro ISD is focused on leveraging E-rate to support digital learning initiatives in K-8 education. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure that all high school students have, or will have, a mobile device, and we are deploying APs in every elementary classroom,\u201d says Reyna. \u201cWe want to expose our K-8 learners to digital learning in the same ways we\u2019ve worked with high school students.\u201d In addition to what\u2019s happening inside classroom walls, the district is also engaging local business to provide Internet access for students at restaurants and other companies to keep learning top-of-mind. \u201cUltimately, this holistic approach\u2014and our focus on technology\u2014puts Socorro ISD on the road to crafting strong global citizens, and ones that can move into higher education without boundaries or limitations,\u201d says Reyna.\n\u201cWhen we look at our teachers and our students, we see that the engagement is better, the attendance is higher, and discipline is down. These types of gains are thanks in large part to our new wireless environment.\u201d Hector Reyna, Chief Technology Officer"

Founded in 1998, Vector Media quickly spread nationwide, with central offices in New York and Las Vegas and numerous branch locations including Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, and Boston.\nDan Dorato, Vector Media\u2019s CTO, has been with the company for over thirteen years. As Vector Media has grown, his team of three IT staff was spread too thin, as they attempted to maintain a cumbersome Astaro network infrastructure across multiple locations. The network demanded one employee\u2019s constant attention to manage the appliances and configuration changes, and all of the branch locations went offline whenever the primary WAN connection went down.\n\u201cWe left a lot of locations in the lurch when we had a primary uplink down,\u201d Dorato explained. \u201cIt was painful.\u201d\nFurthermore, because Vector Media\u2019s employees depend on information-sharing between locations, the slow and inconsistent network connection caused significant and unacceptable delays and resource drains.\n\u201cWe handle a lot of throughput at Vector Media \u2014 we\u2019ve got very large files shooting back and forth from coast to coast,\u201d Dorato said. While he estimates average file size at 20 MB, Vector employees frequently transfer files that are 2 GB or larger. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to stick through a pipe, and I was spending a ton of money upgrading the WAN connections to support the files. I couldn\u2019t manage the networks reliably anymore \u2014 it was a full-time job for me, besides handling day-to-day issues and managing my team. I decided it was time to find something new.\u201d\nDorato looked at networking solutions from Meraki, Juniper, SonicWall, and Watchguard. When he tested Meraki\u2019s cloud-managed security appliances, he was sold on the rich visibility and easy multi-site management, which enabled him to see his networking hardware at every location from a single dashboard. \u201cIt was love at first sight once I saw the Meraki dashboard,\u201d he said. \u201cSearching is easy, reporting is easy. The insight and visibility into what\u2019s happening on the network is wonderful.\u201d\nDorato deployed MX security appliances across far-flung Vector offices and had the network up and running in less than an hour. \u201cI migrated the network by myself \u2014 it was insanely simple,\u201d Dorato explained. \u201cI used the cloud controller to stage everything, we dispatched the MX\u2019s to the remote offices, and employees with no technical experience simply plugged them in. Within a matter of minutes, the devices connected and established the VPN links. It was a breath of fresh air, to say the least.\u201d Meanwhile, Dorato is using the MX\u2019s built-in smart link bonding to utilize multiple WAN connections, thus maximizing uptime and increasing bandwidth.\nIn addition to the security appliances, Vector Media deployed Meraki cloud-managed wireless access points (APs) at headquarters to provide greater mobility for employees. Dorato also uses Meraki\u2019s Systems Manager to remotely manage all of the users and devices on the network, including remote software installation. Thus, he has visibility and control over the entire network \u2014 including his security appliances, his wireless APs, and all client devices \u2014 through a single web-based interface. In particular, this visibility has enabled him to discover and solve bandwidth usage problems quickly.\n\u201cOne user\u2019s email use was through the roof and I had no idea why,\u201d he said. \u201cTurns out, a message was caught in a loop with the Exchange server. In about four clicks, I solved the problem that would have taken me hours before.\u201d\nDorato is also deploying Meraki APs across a fleet of vehicles for transit advertising. Using a combination of multi-modem cellular and speed burst technology, he is able to provide continuous Internet access for customers. He uses traffic shaping to throttle high-bandwidth applications and content filtering to block inappropriate content, and he gets real-time notifications when the buses go online or offline. \u201cThis solution has knocked the socks off our transit partners,\u201d he said.\nOverall, Dorato emphasizes that the Meraki solution has eliminated network downtime, increased employee productivity, cut bandwidth costs, reduced helpdesk calls, and simplified network management. \u201cThe truth is, when I saw that the Meraki hardware was priced significantly lower than the competition, I assumed something was missing,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out that what was missing was the complexity.\u201d\nVector Media Lowers Bandwidth Costs and Accelerates Productivity with Meraki"

    "text": "Colegio Sagrada Familia Hijas de Jes\u00fas is a school in Valladolid, Spain for children aged 0 to 18 years old. With 1,100 students, the IT team\u2019s challenge is to ensure that the networking environment is reliable and meets the students\u2019 various needs.\nThe school is composed of two buildings and a sports centre, and the IT team had plans to set up a 1:1 environment for students of the secondary school. This brought challenges that required the networking environment to be refreshed, and the team chose a full-stack Cisco Meraki solution, with Meraki APs, switches, security appliances and mobility management.\nThe IT team is composed of only one member, V\u00edctor Arenzana Hern\u00e1ndez, who manages the networks in the school as a part-time job.\nThe hardware that was already in use was out-dated and deficient, and simply didn\u2019t provide a sufficient Wi-Fi signal. Hern\u00e1ndez therefore wanted to provide a stable, more reliable connection to offer students and staff a better work and study environment.\nThere were plans for a 1:1 deployment in the school, for around 550 students in secondary school, and for all 90 teachers.\nThe centralised, browser-based Meraki dashboard is what made the difference for the team. Being able to manage the school\u2019s networks and devices remotely was a revelation.\nThe fact that Meraki offers a full-stack solution was a clear advantage for the school\u2019s team. With other vendors, they would have had to use different brands for various parts of the network, and then would have had to work out how to make them work together. With a full-stack Meraki deployment, it is easy to troubleshoot an issue from the client to the AP, the switch to the security appliance, in one single pane of glass.\nThe option to configure Meraki hardware even before it arrived on site was a crucial factor in the team\u2019s decision. When the hardware was delivered and plugged in, the configurations were automatically downloaded and the network was up and running in a matter of minutes.\nThe team worked with a partner to physically deploy Meraki at the school, and to set up the initial network configuration. The MX100 security appliance was chosen for its capacity of supporting 500+ clients. Two MS220 and two MS320 switches were chosen to connect two of the school\u2019s buildings with a 10GB fibre connection. Meraki MR32 802.11ac APs were chosen for deployment in the classrooms, where client density is likely to be high, and Meraki MR18 802.11n APs were selected for the sports centre.\nThe network was configured with 4 SSIDs: one for students, one for teachers, a third one for administrative staff, and a fourth for guests. Facebook WiFi, built in to the Meraki dashboard, was enabled for the guest SSID. Guests are prompted to check-in to the school\u2019s Facebook page to gain access to the WiFi. This gives the school access to aggregate and anonymous demographic data that Facebook provides about check-ins \u2014 statistics like the age and gender of the people that are joining the network.\nThe team set up six VLANs on the MX security appliance (separating the traffic for teachers, students, staff, projectors, VoIP and servers), in a matter of a few simple clicks and without needing to know any complex command lines. Just as easily, the three SSIDs for students, teachers and staff were aligned to their respective VLANs using VLAN tagging in the dashboard.\nThe entire Meraki dashboard is entirely GUI-based, making it incredibly intuitive and completely removing the need for CLI.\nSystems Manager, Cisco Meraki\u2019s mobility management tool, allows the IT team to tag student and teacher devices. This means they can be grouped to assign configurations en masse, or deploy applications to hundreds of devices at once.\nWith geofencing rules, it is possible to limit students\u2019 activities while they are at school and during school hours, to ensure they focus on their day\u2019s classes. This is ideal for a BYOD environment for all operating systems, without worrying about what might be happening on the network. These restrictions on students\u2019 activities are removed as soon as they leave the school site.\nThe IT team has set automatic reporting emails allowing them to stay aware of what\u2019s happening on the network without actively monitoring the dashboard, and then easily update the network configurations according to users\u2019 needs.\nIn the first month of the Meraki network being used, students were already passing 1.38TB worth of data, and the usage is expected to keep increasing as more students and more staff log on to the network. The difference in connectivity was noticed right away, with an overwhelmingly positive reaction."

    "text": "When Chris Biggers joined the Boutique Hotel Collection (BHC) as the hotel management group\u2019s lead IT manager, he immediately identified some challenges with the technology deployments in key properties.\nBHC, located in San Luis Obispo County, California, employs roughly 1,000 people and oversees 13 properties (for a total of 600 rooms) located along the Golden State\u2019s scenic central coast. BHC\u2019s properties, known for offering guests gorgeous ocean views and fantastic amenities, were fielding complaints about poor wireless connectivity in guest rooms at their main hotels \u2014 including their flagship property, the Cliffs Hotel and Spa.\nThe wireless that was in place before Meraki was consumer-grade and mixed vendor from site to site, with no centralized management or reporting. It was intensive to troubleshoot from an IT man-hours perspective, and just a mess from a guest satisfaction perspective.\n\nIT Manager BHC\nIn addition to the issues arising from a mixed vendor, and consumer-grade wireless deployment, the Cliffs Hotel and Spa \u2014 built in the 1970s \u2014 also presented physical constraints: thick concrete walls and metal studding, which absorbed much of the RF signal being emitted from the wireless access points (APs) in place. These issues resulted in frequent guest complaints and equipment failure \u2014 but there were no easy ways to know the health or connectivity status of the network until someone called IT.\nThe growing negative reviews concerning guest Wi-Fi were unacceptable to Chris, who began evaluating solutions. He had followed Cisco Meraki\u2019s progress since their beginning as an MIT project, so was already aware of the benefits \u2014 scalability, simplicity, centralized control \u2014 that Meraki\u2019s cloud management solution brings. He decided to install Meraki MR access points across BHC\u2019s properties.\nChris\u2019 small team of three IT staff easily deployed 200 Meraki APs across 13 sites thanks to the ability to preconfigure network and AP settings remotely, before Meraki equipment is ever plugged into power or the internet. This allows a smooth, plug-and-play experience when physically hooking up APs.\nThe plug-and-play aspect of it saved us hundreds of hours. That time and money really adds up. So the cloud features of the deployment shaved probably at least a month off of our deployment cycle.\n\nIT Manager BHC\nMeraki\u2019s intuitive, web-based dashboard allows Chris visibility into, and control over, his Meraki access points, connected client devices, and all applications consuming bandwidth using one accessible interface.\n\nChris also decided to deploy Meraki MR30H wall plate APs at BHC\u2019s four main hotels, including the Cliffs Hotel and Spa. The MR30H \u2014 which sports 802.11ac Wave 2 2\u00d72 MU-MIMO wireless and integrated, gigabit switch ports \u2014 is a part of the MR wireless product family that Chris has been excited to test.\nHaving these MR30H units deployed at the Cliffs Hotel and Spa was great because we\u2019re able to utilize the existing hardline connection, put one AP in every other suite, dial back the power on the unit significantly so the wireless just stays confined to two suites, and then we didn\u2019t lose the hardline connection because it has four ports on the bottom. It was a perfect use case for that.\n\nBHC IT Manager\nIn fact, the MR30H deployment has helped the hotel offer better amenities, since the suites now have dedicated wireless access in addition to four hardline ports that guests can use for laptops or other electronics (or that allow the Cliffs Hotel and Spa to more easily service amenities like IPTVs or VoIP phones).\nOf the many features available to Meraki MR access points, two that Chris\u2019 IT team use are the RF Spectrum Overview and Radio Settings pages in the Meraki dashboard \u2014 which help Chris ensure access points are optimally placed to minimize interference \u2014 and the out-of-the-box location analytics help him better understand guest behavior and foot traffic throughout his properties.\n\nThe success of the Meraki MR access points led Chris to consider other product portfolios. He now has Meraki MX security appliances installed at every property and serving as the primary firewall. The centralized policy management they enable for full Cisco AMP intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS) helps BHC satisfy many legal requirements.\nIn addition, BHC now uses Meraki\u2019s Enterprise Mobility Management solution, Systems Manager, for all company-owned mobile assets and computers. This enables Chris to do things like apply central policies, push applications, remotely control, geofence, and selectively wipe these devices.\n\nFinally, Chris\u2019 favorite feature about all Meraki products is how easy it is to stay updated on product feature velocity. As he says, \u201cWith Meraki, there actually are constant product improvement and stability upgrades, which we truly appreciate because our product refresh cycle is fairly long. Knowing that we won\u2019t have to refresh every 18 months or so and that we\u2019re going to continue to have support for the products for their entire lifecycle is really what helps us sell it to our leadership team.\u201d\nLooking forward, Chris says he and his team are further investigating the use of Bluetooth\u00ae and beaconing technology that is built into every Meraki AP. The goal is to investigate possibilities for deploying next-generation use cases, such as integrating Bluetooth\u00ae, mobile apps, and location analytics to offer context- and location-aware experiences to guests. One example would be to have a discount offer appear on a guest\u2019s mobile phone when they walk by hotel spa facilities.\n\nDeploying Meraki across BHC\u2019s properties has saved Chris and his team significant time and troubleshooting. The Cliffs Hotel and Spa now boasts robust, stable guest wireless and is no longer receiving complaints and poor reviews from guests about their technology experience. Chris has more visibility and control over his geographically dispersed networks than he ever had before.\nWhat final thoughts would he like to share for anyone considering a Meraki solution?\n\nOur company has become a huge Meraki fan, not just because we like the technology, but honestly because it\u2019s transformed our business and allowed us to have the kind of guest satisfaction that the hospitality industry is all about.\n\nIT Manager BHC"

    "text": "Interested in learning about Cisco Meraki cloud managed solutions?\nCheck out our webinars page for our upcoming live webinars.\nSoulCycle, a New York City-based fitness company, offers customers dynamic and energetic classes that are \u201can alternative to the fitness routines that [feel] like work.\u201d With over 60 studios spread across the United States, SoulCycle prides itself on delivering inspirational and high-energy indoor cycling classes for its customers. To continue this tradition of scalable and innovative experiences for their customers, SoulCycle decided to deploy Cisco Meraki security appliances in each of their locations.\nWhen Derek McWilliams, the IT engineer responsible for all of SoulCycle\u2019s IT infrastructure, first started at the company, he quickly became frustrated with the traditional networking infrastructure that had been deployed before he joined. Having first tested MR Access Points at a previous company, he was already impressed that Meraki hardware \u201cliterally deployed in 15 minutes\u201d and how they \u201ctook longer to put up on the wall than it did to configure them.\u201d Wanting security features in addition to cloud management, Derek then began testing and installing MX Security Appliances in all of their locations.\nDue to the template-based configuration, ease of connecting different sites to their corporate network, and simple remote deployment functionality, Derek decided to opt for MX Security Appliances. Prior to his deployment of the MX, if he wanted to add any new hardware to the SoulCycle network, Derek would receive the hardware, do an initial configuration on his end, send it to a remote team for on-premise deployment, and then Derek would have to do a final configuration after the deployment. Since 99% of their studios have identical settings and configurations, this quickly became a tedious and redundant process.\nMeraki has helped SoulCycle be aggressive in terms of our deployments, our growth, and our scale. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another product out there that can allow us to do IT refreshes in the time that we have with Meraki.\n\nIT Engineer at SoulCycle\nNow, with MX appliances, Derek is able to easily utilize configuration templates, which can allow many Cisco Meraki devices to be deployed following a single base configuration. As Derek explained, \u201cWhen I saw the template configurations, that really opened my eyes to how we could quickly deploy an MX as we open more studios.\u201d This means that with the push of a button Derek can have a pre-configured network up and running with his exact specifications. If any networks need further customization, additional configurations can easily be made on top of the template-based network. This makes new site rollouts exceptionally easy for Derek and his lean IT team. In fact, due to the speed of deployment, Derek said his team was actually a month ahead of schedule during their initial roll-out. This decrease in network configuration time helps the SoulCycle IT team focus on more important tasks, like maintenance of server infrastructure.\nThe SoulCycle team has also utilized the Layer 7 firewall rules on the MX, which provide the ability to create rules to deny certain traffic based on traffic type. For example, a network administrator can easily block all P2P and gaming traffic via intelligent fingerprinting that is built into all MX appliances. As Derek put it, \u201cLayer 7 firewall rules are something with the MX that\u2019s out-of-the-box that we didn\u2019t get with our previous solution. The old solution could do Layer 3, port and protocols, but we couldn\u2019t block certain types of traffic unless we paid extra for additional licenses.\u201d Furthermore, due to Meraki\u2019s straightforward \u201cone license for one piece of hardware\u201d model, SoulCycle\u2019s MX Security Appliances are future-proof and will continue receiving updates and functionality long after they have been deployed.\nBeyond template-based deployments and Layer 7 firewall rules, Derek also cited how easy it was to set up site-to-site VPN tunnels between the SoulCycle corporate office and their various studios. He said that when it comes to setting up corporate offices, \u201cthe hard work is done by Meraki, while the easy bit is done by me.\u201d Halfway through their MX deployment in studios, Derek deployed an MX100 in their Los Angeles corporate office. He said, \u201cI had another IT engineer remotely do the same setup and configuration that we used for studios, with the only difference being that it was a hub and not a spoke. Within a couple of minutes, the LA office already had tunnels established to all of our other networks. To put this in context, with our previous solution, the same task would have taken me 7-8 hours to do.\u201d\nLooking forward, Derek shared that it is the ease of use, speed of deployment, and simple scalability of the Meraki solution that has helped SoulCycle achieve their company motto to be dynamic and to \u201cmove fast.\u201d Specifically, he said, \u201cMeraki has helped SoulCycle be aggressive in terms of our deployments, our growth, and our scale. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another product out there that can allow us to do IT refreshes in the time that we have with Meraki.\u201d\n\nRetail Case Study & TCO Analysis: Victra\nPCI Compliance Whitepaper\nMeraki MX for Retail"

    "text": "TOZ is the first work-space provider organization in Korea. The company plans, deploys, and operates community gatherings, meetings, study groups, business meetings, educational events, and office space according to customers\u2019 needs. Since TOZ first opened in 2002, it has expanded rapidly. As of December 2016, TOZ was operating 259 centers and serving more than 12 million people.\nTOZ aims to be the best co-working space service group by providing a differentiated, multi-purpose space service with new concepts such as MoimCenter, Business Center, Study Center, Smart Work Center and MICS Center. Also, TOZ is planning to expand overseas and become the top space service provider in Asia within the next 5 years.\nWith the expansion of TOZ\u2019s reach, offering a fast, secure, and stable network that satisfies users has become even more important. A stable, high-performance network is critical for TOZ\u2019s mission, because the physical space as well as the technical infrastructure must be perfectly suited to how the customers use the space.\nAs the use of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops increases rapidly, businesses must provide high-performance wireless network services to compete in this mobile-first era. In order to proactively respond to customer needs, TOZ implemented its wireless network with the Cisco Meraki network solution.\nOne major reason TOZ chose Meraki was the increasing popularity of smartphone use in group settings. To meet the needs of its customers, TOZ needed to replace existing equipment with high-performance network services.\nAlso, due to the rapid growth of TOZ\u2019s business, there was a need to centrally control about 250 business department networks scattered across the nation. The Cisco Meraki solution met both of those needs.\nTOZ has deployed the cloud-based Meraki network environment to about 130 centers since it started installing Meraki in October 2016. New Meraki solutions will be deployed in 160 new centers to be opened in 2017.\nTOZ conducted a thorough evaluation before deciding which vendor would provide the optimal wireless network environment. The Cisco Meraki solution and several different vendor\u2019s products were each used to build a respective network environment, and were thoroughly tested for 6 weeks. TOZ ultimately chose Cisco Meraki for its exceptional performance in terms of speed, reliability, and ease of management.\nIt took about 3 months to deploy equipment and review the results of the scenarios. The test was successfully completed and finally the decision was made thanks to Cisco\u2019s active support for Meraki test equipment as well as the deployment company iCent\u2019s support with staff and efforts.\nThe Meraki deployment consists of MR wireless APs, MS PoE/Ethernet Switches, MX Security Appliances, and Systems Manager, the Meraki enterprise mobility management solution, and more. Meraki cloud-managed IT solutions are easy to manage and provide excellent scalability, reliability and security.\nCurrently there are 2 Meraki PoE Switches and 4-7 MR Access Points at each of the 130 TOZ centers, with more product families to be deployed in the near future. Meraki MR supports real-time analysis/control of traffic use by user/application, strong wireless security using the separate dedicated radio, RF analysis and auto-tuning/optimization, etc. Furthermore, it can help minimize the time and cost of deployment because it supports all the features in a cloud environment, without adding a separate hardware.\nTOZ improved management efficiency after introducing Meraki, which supports handy deployment, management and troubleshooting of its distributed network, by providing a stable network and utilizing its diverse features. Above all, TOZ is pleased with the Meraki solution because all devices can be monitored in real-time from one dashboard.\nMeraki allows visibility into the whole network topology and detailed information for troubleshooting, as well as easy tagged network-based settings such as editing configuration information, appointing managers and reporting. Also, it can minimize risks by setting the admin access authority level as appropriate, while maximizing management efficiency by providing a variety of remote diagnostic features such as running cable tests and packet captures.\nThanks to Meraki, TOZ can now check all centers\u2019 real-time status at a glance via the network topology and location heat maps features. The TOZ team can also see how much and what kind of traffic is on the network, and how many people at each center. This visibility makes it possible to respond quickly and accurately to any issues.\nEfficient traffic management is possible due to features that allow admins to control network traffic at the individual device levels. Furthermore, with the enterprise mobility management solution, admins can intuitively find a device\u2019s location and set security features. These benefits allow TOZ to efficiently and consistently manage IT assets."

    "text": "Founded in 1919, holding the fifth oldest active contractor license in the state, C.W. Driver is one of the longest-operating contracting firms headquartered in California. Their client list spans prestigious higher education institutes like the University of Southern California, to high-end retailers like Bloomingdale\u2019s, to major corporations like DreamWorks Animation.\nWithin the last decade, C.W. Driver underwent rapid growth, increasing employee count by almost 3 times. Yet, as the company grew, their IT infrastructure remained the same, which was inadequate to support their increasing user load.\nThe ability to centrally manage the entire network was important for C.W. Driver. Multiple project sites are active simultaneously all throughout the state of California. Initially, the wireless configurations and network architecture, including the physical hardware devices, varied greatly. Employees had to deal with inconsistent wireless experiences from site to site and across regional offices, and IT struggled to manage such a fragmented network.\nAs Blaine Crawford, Director of Information Technology, explains it, \u201cthe pre-existing WAN architecture was 8 years out of date, the MPLS circuits were too expensive and didn\u2019t have enough bandwidth, and we were using end-of-life equipment that could only be found on eBay.\u201d It was time for a change.\nWhen Crawford began at C.W. Driver, his main goal was to establish a cost-efficient, standardized network that would support over 500 employees across 7 regional offices, enable open space access larger than the regional offices, and equip up to 40 remote project sites that could have as many as 9 mobile trailers and more than 30 people per shift. Most importantly, C.W. Driver wanted to be sure to provide a consistent, quality network experience for all end users, no matter where they were located.\nFor Crawford and his regionally dispersed IT team, Meraki\u2019s cloud-managed security and wireless devices, which users can access and manage through a simple web-based dashboard, not only made it easy to set up multiple job sites but also manage their entire network remotely from a single location.\nWe no longer have to send people all over the county\u2014you know, LA County, San Diego County\u2014fly them up to San Jose to configure job sites. We can do it all from an arm chair in the \u201cmission control\u201d room of the IT department.\n\nDirector, Information Technology\nThe new Meraki network was set up so that regional offices and job sites had almost identical networking experiences. Regional offices utilize MX80 Security Appliances, with the data center housing a single MX400 for the VPN hub. Job sites are similar in set up, with MX64s at smaller sites or MX80s at larger sites.\n\u201cSimply by deploying the Meraki devices, almost immediately everything was standardized,\u201d Crawford said.\nEventually, Blaine and his team created their own \u201cNIAB,\u201d or Network-in-a-Box, which is a self-service site set up kit. In the NIAB is a portable metal case that includes a standard network equipment rack, rack mount UPS and LAN switch and a shelf with a Meraki MX device bolted into it. The IT team then uses Meraki\u2019s automatic Site-to-Site VPN to configure the devices and connect the sites without ever having to do a manual on-site VPN configuration. From there, anyone at the site can just plug in the Internet and the network will be up and running. As Blaine described it, \u201cit\u2019s pretty much just \u2018plug n\u2019 play\u2019.\u201d No additional configurations and no onsite IT assistance are required, both major benefits for their lean IT team.\nFrom HQ, Blaine and his team use the Meraki dashboard to monitor bandwidth usage and enforce best practices for a more efficient network, such as placing limits on music streaming and P2P applications. Meraki cloud management provides real-time visibility into the network, which has enabled the IT team to proactively detect any ISP outages or failures in the system, so that patches can be made before business hours even begin.\nIn one instance, one of the offices was experiencing latency issues, so the IT team used the dashboard to monitor traffic flows. The problem was traced back to a client device that was automatically downloading Windows updates. The IT team just adjusted their settings to avoid bandwidth constraints by scheduling major application updates to only be made during off-business hours.\nToday, C.W. Driver utilizes Meraki devices to maximize security, remote management, and an overall standardization of their ever-changing network. They were able to cancel out many extraneous expenses such as MPLS contracts, expensive controllers, and high fees from consultants who had previously managed their internal WAN architecture. The additional security and malware protection of Meraki MXs also eliminated the need for an entirely separate security budget. Now, the entire network is managed in-house through a single budget, and cost savings were realized within the year.\nCrawford and his team were able to turn the previously inadequate and stressed IT situation into a successful and efficient network that is capable of supporting the company\u2019s growth and business needs. From Crawford\u2019s perspective, everything has improved dramatically, from the overall networking experience to the cleanliness and presentation of the IT closet.

    "text": "Founded in 1966, Shaw Communications is a diversified telecommunications company serving Western Canada with broadband Internet, WiFi, video, and digital phone services as well as wireless services through its recent acquisition of WIND Mobile. Through its subsidiary Shaw Business, the company owns and operates a national fibre-optic backbone network providing data networking, video, voice, and Internet services to companies of all sizes.\nAs a trusted advisor for small and medium sized Canadian businesses (SMBs), Shaw Business wanted to make WiFi and network security more affordable and manageable for such companies. \u201cSmall and medium sized growing companies can have limited budgets and IT resources,\u201d said Ron McKenzie, Senior Vice President, Business. \u201cWe believe providing WiFi can be more than just connectivity\u2014it can be a powerful customer retention and marketing tool, a competitive advantage, and a fundamental characteristic of a forward-thinking business.\u201d\nMeraki\u2019s cloud-based model was attractive to us for its faster deployment, simple and flexible management tools, powerful analytics, and real-time updates.\n\nSenior Vice President, Shaw Business\nAs a result, Shaw Business partnered with Meraki to create SmartWiFi to fulfil the wireless requirements of small- and medium-sized businesses as well as offer them intelligence to help grow their business. \u201cWe were impressed with the feature set Meraki would bring to SmartWiFi,\u201d said McKenzie. \u201cMeraki\u2019s cloud-based model was attractive to us for its faster deployment, simple and flexible management tools, powerful analytics, and real-time updates.\u201d\nMeraki\u2019s cloud-managed architecture with zero-touch provisioning is ideally suited to providing service providers an unrivalled time to market for innovative new services. \u201cIt was clear to us that Cisco Meraki\u2019s technology was the ideal fit for Shaw to use when building SmartWiFi,\u201d said McKenzie. Thousands of SmartWiFi customer deployments can be managed remotely by Shaw using just a web browser\u2014the Meraki dashboard. The dashboard provides a highly intuitive user interface that is devoid of any command lines, allowing Shaw to minimize sales and NOC training requirements as well as to accelerate proof-of-concept testing. Furthermore, Meraki\u2019s straightforward hardware plus licensing model means that for every order of SmartWiFi Shaw receives, only two SKUs are required for the bill of materials: a Meraki wireless access point and its corresponding license.\nSmartWiFi provides small- and medium-sized businesses with fast, reliable, and secure WiFi, which until now was achievable only by large-scale enterprises. \u201cWith SmartWiFi, SMBs can spend less time and money managing their WiFi and focus on their core competency while growing their business,\u201d said McKenzie. \u201cSmartWiFi provides SMBs three secure wireless networks through one Internet connection for staff, guests, and Shaw Go WiFi access, which is a major benefit for business owners.\u201d\nShaw Go WiFi is Canada\u2019s largest WiFi network with hundreds of thousands of users and over 75,000 locations. Shaw Go WiFi customers are able to locate access locations by searching an online directory. By choosing SmartWiFi, small businesses are automatically added as a Shaw Go WiFi network and are able to reach thousands of potentially new customers.\nIn addition to delivering enterprise-grade WiFi to small businesses, SmartWiFi provides powerful information about the devices connecting to their network, as well as insight into customer behaviour to make more informed decisions to improve productivity and enhance customer experience. \u201cGathering usage data from devices and using the included analytics engine returns value to the business in the form of actionable information that can allow the business owner to make better decisions that better suit their customers,\u201d said McKenzie. \u201cFor example, the dashboard has allowed business owners to easily identify the most popular mobile devices on their network and consequently tailor their offers to be better displayed on these devices.\u201d\nShaw provides SmartWiFi customers access to this information in a user-friendly format at no additional cost or increased complexity through an online portal. SmartWiFi customers are provided \u2018monitor-only\u2019 rights to their business\u2019 dashboard that is the same view Shaw NOC staff would see, but with a streamlined configuration view. Business owners can manage basic wireless settings for staff and guest networks such as SSID name, encryption, and splash page for easy self-service. Moreover Shaw was able to customize the monitor-only view of the dashboard further with Shaw Business branding and with the standard Meraki support number replaced by the SmartWiFi helpdesk telephone number.\n\u201cWe have a simple three-tier pricing model so SMBs have a plan that fits their needs for download and upload speeds, data allowances, and number of connected devices,\u201d said McKenzie. SmartWiFi packages are inclusive of an Internet connection, meaning SMBs have a consolidated flat-rate monthly cost from a single provider, three fully managed wireless networks, and access to support services.\nMeraki allows Shaw to get customer sites live with SmartWiFi in remarkably short order. Once an order for SmartWiFi is received, a Shaw technician is dispatched to the customer location to perform a survey to determine how many APs are needed. No configuration of the access point itself is required. While the technician is on site, Shaw NOC staff create a new network by cloning settings from a master network in their multi-tenanted Meraki dashboard and adding the required number of Meraki wireless access points. This entire process is complete in a matter of minutes and with a few simple mouse-clicks. The Meraki APs now simply need to be plugged in, at which point the APs tunnel a secure connection to the cloud and download their configuration settings to start broadcasting the three SSIDs.\nMeraki allows Shaw to provide SmartWiFi customers with outstanding customer service, with most support cases resolved in real-time. For troubleshooting tasks that would typically require a network technician to be called on site, such as packet captures, Shaw NOC staff are able to work through these issues remotely via the dashboard. \u201cWe want Shaw Business to be an extension of our customers\u2019 IT department,\u201d explained McKenzie. \u201cIf they need support, Shaw Business will be there online or over the phone to resolve issues and ensure SmartWiFi is delivering value to their business.\u201d\nSmartWiFi has proven to be a great success for Shaw Business in a short period of time, having already amassed a large number of happy customers. The IT manager of one particular architecture firm that has implemented SmartWiFi said their employees and guests are thrilled with the speed and robustness of the network. \u201cWe\u2019ve had many customers tell us how much value SmartWiFi has brought to their businesses,\u201d said McKenzie. \u201cThey\u2019re happy with the quality of the WiFi and how easy it is to manage, and they are excited by the wealth of business insight they receive about device usage and the user habits that the analytics provide.\u201d"

    "text": "Hydroscand AB is the market leader in hydraulic hose and fluid component sales in Scandinavia with a mission to continuously meet the increasing needs of customers, while remaining efficient and profitable. The company has grown significantly since its establishment in 1969 as a small family business in Stockholm. Just a few decades later, it has expanded to include warehouses, distribution stores, and offices throughout Europe, supporting thousands of customers in 17 countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa.\nWith such a distributed organization, having a simple to manage, unified network was critical to the company\u2019s on-going growth. However, in addition to the high density usage in their offices, Hydroscand had numerous other concerns to take into consideration, including highly dispersed locations and warehouses with challenging wireless environments. \u201cWarehouses around EMEA and APAC have steel shelves packed with steel reinforced hoses, valves, and hose fittings,\u201d explained Ronnie Wallman, Systems Engineer at Hydroscand AB. \u201cAnd last, but not least, the fluorescent lights, jitter, radio signals, and cross-talk from forklift loading stations cause even more problems in our high density environment.\u201d\nWireless connectivity supports a variety of employees using mobile devices and handheld scanners, shared devices like wireless printers, and equipment used in emergency situations. The answer provided by the previous wireless solution was to add more access points to increase coverage, merely masking the problem. Armed with a list of infrastructure requirements, Wallman began looking at other vendors, gradually eliminating solutions due to added costs, missing feature sets, or lack of transparency. \u201cWe had all of our demands written down,\u201d said Wallman of the process. \u201cPrice, firewall, encryption, scalability, high availability, hardware for anything from small branches to warehouses, manageable for a small IT staff\u2026\u201d the list goes on.\nInitially, Hydroscand purchased a mix of Meraki datacenter security appliances, Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches, and high performance 802.11ac wireless access points to outfit their headquarters, Stockholm warehouse, and brand new Estonia warehouse. Installing the devices in the headquarters location and the Stockholm warehouse were important, but the top priority was the new warehouse in Estonia, which was in the process of being built.\nThe Meraki solution works out great. We easily deploy new sites and get reports on what\u2019s going on in our network every day. Also, you get simplicity \u2013 one thing that could take hours to do is now done over a cup of coffee.\n\nSystems Engineer\nPrior to their first visit to the warehouse, Wallman and his colleague Fredrik Fehler had plotted approximate access point placement using a blueprint. The evening before they went onsite, Wallman logged into the Meraki dashboard from his phone and configured each part of the soon-to-be installed network. After raising an MR34 AP into the air using a forklift and verifying radio signals, the devices were outfitted in the warehouse and operational in just two days. \u201cWe mounted up all the MR34s in the ceiling and installed the MX80s and MS switches,\u201d explained Wallman. \u201cThe MX80 successfully synced up to the cloud and some routing was done to our datacenter; the VPN was in place.\u201d\nSince this initial deployment, Wallman and his team have gone on to deploy the Meraki solution in numerous other warehouses and retail locations. Each of the sites seamlessly connects back to an MX400 security appliance located in the Stockholm datacenter via a secure site-to-site VPN connection with each location\u2019s branch MX device. These VPN connections can be configured in three mouse clicks \u2013 with security associations, key exchanges, and security policies handled automatically. The site-to-site connections are also self-healing, meaning they automatically update in dynamic IP environments. Instead of going on-site, Wallman and his team can monitor the VPN status from their Meraki dashboard and can enable custom firewall policies to govern the entire VPN network.\n\u201cWe have deployed to six countries, and only one of these countries has on-site IT staff,\u201d Wallman said. \u201cAll we need to deploy equipment is a blueprint and some photos from the site. We monitor and maintain everything from Hydroscand Stockholm HQ.\u201d\nHydroscand employees in offices, warehouses, and retail stores rely on the network to perform their daily functions. Wallman explained, \u201chand scanners and wireless printers, using the 802.11ac wireless standard on the MR34 access points, have to work for our warehouse employees, otherwise we will not produce anything.\u201d Segmented SSIDs have been created for each type of user to ensure they have access to necessary resources. In the production area, one SSID for the hand scanners and wireless printers has been provisioned. Users accessing the network on company-issued devices authenticate to separate SSID using 802.1X RADIUS login. Another SSID with no LAN privileges, bandwidth limitations, Layer 7 application traffic shaping, and a captive portal has been established for guests.\n\u201cA really nice feature with Cisco Meraki is that you can direct a specific SSID to broadcast on an appointed MR34 access point,\u201d described Wallman. \u201cMeraki does all this with a nice GUI that all of the IT staff can understand and manage.\u201d For example, company-owned devices can be tagged with group policies in the dashboard to give them varying bandwidth restrictions at certain times of day. Because company devices are already configured with RADIUS authentication, employees just need to sign into the guest network with any non-corporate devices. This allows Hydroscand to maintain a heightened level of security, while also satisfying employees by providing a network that simply works.\nWhile Wallman\u2019s team has found the configuration tools in dashboard to be incredibly useful during their deployments, they\u2019re also taking advantage of the other built-in features to further optimize the network environment. Using remote tools, the team is able to quickly resolve IP conflicts, add different Active Directory service accounts, lockdown inappropriate web content, shape bandwidth usage by application, and more. Saving time and cost is important to any business, and taking advantage of these tools and the increased coverage of the Meraki APs allows them to do both. Before deploying Meraki, the Oslo warehouse required 16 APs; now with only 10 Meraki MR34 APs, they\u2019re covering not just the warehouse, but also the adjoining office space.\n\u201cThe Meraki solution works out great. We easily deploy new sites and get reports on what\u2019s going on in our network every day. You get reports with screenshots done for the executive level in minutes,\u201d Wallman said. \u201cAlso, you get simplicity \u2013 one thing that could take hours to do is now done over a cup of coffee.\u201d"

    "text": "Based in Phoenix, Arizona, Make-A-Wish\u00ae is a nonprofit with a powerful mission to grant the wish of every child diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition. Whether it\u2019s becoming a pilot, going bug hunting, or beautifying the neighborhood, Make-A-Wish and its 27,000 volunteers work to make every wish come true.\nWith a wish being granted, on average, every 35 minutes, Make-A-Wish does not have the bandwidth to deal with an unreliable network. To enable employees to spend as much time as possible granting wishes, Make-A-Wish turns to Meraki cloud managed access points, switches, security appliances, and mobility management for a reliable, comprehensive, and empowering IT solution.\nJeff Pick, Director of Technology for Make-A-Wish America, works at the National Office in Phoenix to support the 62 local Make-A-Wish chapters around the country. When he began working at Make-A-Wish, each chapter had its own networking gear, and there was no way to troubleshoot or easily communicate between chapters. Alongside the management challenges that accompanied this agglomeration of patchwork equipment, leadership was also calling for an increase in security and governance across the organization. With approximately 110 physical locations and a lean team of engineers, Jeff knew he needed a secure, easy-to-use, centralized management platform to efficiently support each location and meet the Board\u2019s requirements.\nEnter Meraki. After evaluating many competing networking solutions, Make-A-Wish chose to go with a full Meraki setup at every location. \u201cMeraki was cost-effective with a good feature set. We did a trial, and it was so easy to configure, and could notify us if anything was going wrong on the network,\u201d he said. At every Make-A-Wish chapter, you will soon be able to find a Meraki MX Security Appliance, MS Switch, and a number of MR Access Points as Jeff and his team continue rolling each location over to Meraki.\nEach individual MX securely connects to other branch MXs in the Make-A-Wish network, and then back to a master MX400 at headquarters via Meraki Auto VPN. Meraki\u2019s unique auto provisioning site-to-site VPN connects chapters securely, without tedious manual VPN configuration. For this reason, Auto VPN is one of the Make-A-Wish IT team\u2019s favorite Meraki features, as it makes creating these site-to-site tunnels extremely simple, done in seconds with just a few clicks. With these connections, Make-A-Wish is able to share internal resources securely within their organization. These security appliances also include Meraki\u2019s Layer 7 firewall, intrusion prevention, failover and HA, and content filtering, making them extremely powerful and feature-packed devices.\nConnected to every MX is an intelligent MS Switch. In addition to the remote troubleshooting, port-level visibility, and ease of use these backbone switches provide, the topology feature built into MS Switches also offer the Make-A-Wish team with a detailed network map at any time.\nHooked up to the switches are 802.11ac MR Access Points. \u201cMeraki APs have fixed 99% of the wireless errors we were having before.\u201d\nTaking advantage of the flexibility of Meraki, Jeff and the team have set up four SSIDs on the wireless network that are available in every location. The most secure SSID is for employees using foundation-owned devices and requires two-factor authentication. Encrypted on both ends, Jeff and the team can be sure no sensitive data related to wish beneficiaries or donors leaves their network. A second SSID is not broadcast but is provided for visiting guests and volunteers, and grants selective access to local printers and remote desktops. A third SSID is publicly broadcast and guests can check-in using Facebook login and a shared password. \u201cWe\u2019re now able to get greater social media visibility, as well as provide decent WiFi to our visitors,\u201d explained Jeff. \u201cCustom splash pages are coming soon!\u201d\nThe last custom SSID connects employee-owned devices that are enrolled in Make-A-Wish\u2019s Systems Manager network. Systems Manager is the Meraki solution for mobility management, and allows for a wide range of control and visibility over mobile devices including tracking assets, pushing security settings, and installing software. When employees install the Systems Manager client on their devices, Systems Manager automatically pushes the necessary WiFi credentials for the appropriate Make-A-Wish SSID to the devices. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon also be pushing apps via Systems Manager, such as Office 365 and Skype for business,\u201d said Jeff. He and his team are able to track and control all devices connecting to the Make-A-Wish network, providing several layers of security and visibility that did not exist before making the transition to Meraki.\nWith more and more chapters rolling over to a complete Meraki setup, the team has been pleased with the easy plug-and-play nature of Meraki hardware. All Meraki hardware can be pre-configured from the cloud dashboard, shipped to a remote location, and once plugged in, automatically download all settings. This simplifies deploying hardware to dozens of distant sites, as do templates in the Meraki dashboard that allow the cloning of existing settings to new networks. If necessary, tweaking settings and applying custom policies can be done at any time from any device that has access to the Meraki dashboard.\nThe granular control and deep insight afforded by Meraki make monitoring and adjusting network settings easy and empowering. \u201cWe ran into a situation with a local IT vendor that one of our chapters had previously been paying to help manage the network and servers locally at the chapter who didn\u2019t provide us with any passwords or other important information when we converted the chapter over to Meraki. We plugged in the Meraki hardware, started sniffing around, and we were able to discover what was going on and replace the current setup without their help, and with very limited downtime for the chapter. This experience turned one of our senior engineers, originally a skeptic, into a true Meraki believer,\u201d shared Jeff.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also seen great cost savings with Meraki, from the initial hardware purchase to the time and labor savings that we continue to experience,\u201d he said. When new interns started, the team noticed a few network slowdowns. Drilling into the affected networks from their Meraki dashboard, the IT team soon noticed a music streaming app taking up a disproportionate amount of bandwidth, and were able to create rules on the network level to limit bandwidth for that specific application in just a few minutes.\nThe team has also been able to remotely troubleshoot using alerts and live tools. These pings, cable tests, and packet captures combined with the granular visibility into each network has allowed Make-A-Wish to report ISP issues and address power outages as soon as they occur, saving time and money for the organization. \u201cA chapter might not think to call in and tell us there\u2019s a thunderstorm happening, but we want to know when a storm causes the power to go out and the network to go down. With Meraki, now we know,\u201d shared Jeff.\nAs Make-A-Wish America continues to roll out Meraki to all of their chapters, they know they can depend on the reliability, flexibility, and future-proof nature of their cloud managed IT."

    "text": "CDK Global is a leading global provider of integrated information technology and digital marketing solutions to the automotive retail industry. Managing over 11,000 retail client locations in North America alone, CDK has been serving the automotive retail industry for over 40 years with a remarkable average client retention rate of 20 years.\nAs the need for WiFi has become an expectation that brands are reviewed against, many dealerships have reactively opted for unsuitable consumer-grade solutions. \u201cA lot of our customers might not have an in-house IT resource to begin with,\u201d explained Dave Tibbils, Product Marketing Manager at CDK Global. \u201cSo when you add wireless solutions that are intended for home use, you end up with a lot of unhappy users \u2013 staff and customers.\u201d\nPrior to evaluating Meraki, CDK offered customers a limited managed wireless service built on a controller-based architecture. \u201cWe used to offer a partial managed wireless service to automotive dealerships that was used in spot locations within their businesses.\u201d said Tibbils. \u201cIn addition, the legacy access points we used to employ were autonomous and difficult to manage, which consequently restricted us from providing a managed wireless service to parts of a dealership beyond those limited areas.\u201d\nWith a rich heritage of working with automotive dealerships, CDK\u2019s Meraki-powered wireless service \u2018GetWireless\u2019 was developed with dealers in mind. \u201cWe know dealerships want to focus time and resources on their core competencies of selling cars, parts, and services without having to worry about the hassle of network management. They just want wireless to work.\u201d commented Tibbils. \u201cMeraki allowed us to effortlessly tailor GetWireless to align with these needs.\u201d\nGetWireless is a complete wireless service for automotive dealerships, which includes integration into their existing wired network. \u201cGetWireless seamlessly delivers high quality WiFi connectivity and coverage and takes the pressure off the IT person at dealerships,\u201d said Tibbils.\nWith our previous solution, deployment at customer sites would typically take at least one week. With Meraki, the majority of deployments are usually completed within a day\nCDK Implementation Director\n\nThe Meraki dashboard is a multi-tenanted architecture, meaning that CDK is able to remotely manage thousands of dealerships running GetWireless from anywhere in the world. \u201cMeraki\u2019s cloud-managed architecture really changed the game for us and allowed us to become a complete service provider rather than a systems integrator,\u201d explained Tibbils. \u201cUsing Meraki to power GetWireless allows us to provide customers an extraordinary experience as well as being exceptionally cost effective. Zero-touch provisioning delivers the service in short order, and we\u2019re able to react to support cases in real-time.\u201d All Meraki hardware devices, including APs, can be remotely registered and configured using a simple web-browser, even before they arrive at customer sites, meaning there is no on-site configuration required.\nCDK\u2019s service also provides dealerships with visibility about how their network is being used and powerful location-based analytics, such as the number of passers-by vs. visitors, the duration of visits, and their frequency.\nThe Meraki dashboard allows a service provider\u2019s administrator to add users to the dashboard and configure their level of access. In this way, without the delay of having to commission the build-out of a portal, CDK was able to rapidly bring GetWireless to market and provide customers with a \u2018monitor-only\u2019 view of the dashboard. The monitor-only version of the dashboard is a sleek customer-facing, web-based portal that reveals clients connecting to their network, usage, and location-based analytics. \u201cUsage and location-based information is already built into in the Meraki dashboard, so without incurring any additional cost, we can make this accessible to customers so they are able to make more informed business decisions,\u201d said Tibbils. Service providers can adapt the dashboard to be customer facing by branding it with their own logo so their service is consistent with their branding.\nService providers can radically simplify their quotation procedure with Meraki. Meraki licensing is per hardware device and is inclusive of all features so each GetWireless quote consists of only 2 SKUs. \u201cWith just a few SKUs, we\u2019re able to pleasantly surprise customers with a swift quote,\u201d said Michael Jurica, CDK Director of Sales Engineering. CDK\u2019s process for providing a quote for GetWireless involves a survey of the dealership to determine the number of access points required for full coverage as well as to discuss requirements and aspirations for the WiFi. \u201cProviding customers a quote for GetWireless is simple to build for us and simple to understand for dealers,\u201d continued Jurica.\nCustomers are provided with a cost for the design and install of GetWireless, along with a flat recurring rate for ongoing management such as helpdesk, firmware updates, and 24\u00d77 fault monitoring. \u201cRather than charge a fee for individual service items for managing WiFi, we\u2019re able to provide a simple-to-understand fixed monthly rate for GetWireless which is inclusive of all service items,\u201d explained Jurica.\nCDK was able to significantly improve its operational efficiency of deploying a service at customer sites in multiple ways by using Meraki. \u201cWith our previous solution, deployment at customer sites would typically take at least one week,\u201d explained Derek Skillings, CDK Implementation Director. \u201cWith Meraki, the majority of deployments are usually completed within a day.\u201d\nGiven that there is no need for pre-staging, once a dealership places an order for GetWireless, a corresponding order is placed on Meraki for access points to be shipped directly to the customer\u2019s site. CDK\u2019s Implementation team remotely enters the Meraki order number into the dashboard to register the APs and complete the configuration to the dealership\u2019s requirements without ever being on-site. \u201cPreviously we had to have a field service engineer to physically install hardware and a certified wireless engineer on-site for network configuration to get a service online,\u201d said Skillings. CDK can now much more efficiently utilize their wireless engineers by cutting out the need for them to travel to-and-from customer-sites.\n\u201cMeraki has enabled us to roll out much higher quality installs \u2013 we\u2019re able to get the deployment right the first time,\u201d said Skillings. \u201cEven if adjustments need to be made, with Meraki, we\u2019re able to do this remotely in minutes.\u201d Similarly, CDK has minimized the instances for engineers to be called out to customer sites, as most helpdesk cases can be diagnosed and resolved remotely using tools built into the dashboard such as over-the-web packet capture, cable testing, and RF spectrum analysis.\nGetWireless has been a resounding success for CDK with thousands of Meraki devices deployed across hundreds of dealerships, thus far collectively transferring over 20TB of traffic, on average, every week. CDK is now exploring the creation of new services powered by the fullstack of Meraki devices \u2013 APs, switches, security appliances and MDM.\n"

    "text": "You can take the boys out of Texas, but you can\u2019t take the Texas out of the boys. In \u201886, some good ol\u2019 Texans found themselves hunting for home style cookin\u2019 in Canada\u2026with little success. They knew there was one way to fix that. And that\u2019s how the Lone Star Texas Grill came to be. Bold flavors, warm service, and a fantastic dining experience grew the business overnight, and now Lone Star boasts 24 locations across Canada. Lucky for Lone Star, Cisco Meraki and Cloud4Wi were able to provide the WiFi service, data, and analytics needed to support such a rapidly growing restaurant chain.\nWhen you\u2019re pursuing a passion, you don\u2019t have time to be bogged down manually configuring switches or troubleshooting uplinks. Bob Macey, Lone Star\u2019s senior product manager, understood his priorities, \u201cFirst and foremost, we\u2019re a restaurant company. We focus on food and service. [\u2026] We don\u2019t want to spend a lot maintaining our IT.\u201d This is why Macey and team knew the best solution for them would be cloud-based, easily deployed, quick, and reliable.\nTech revamps often beget tech headaches. But the Meraki cloud networking solution was able to alleviate the tech headaches before they started. No troubleshooting necessary. After a successful deployment in their flagship restaurant, Lone Star was ready to go full-Meraki. According to Macey, \u201cWithin two weeks we had rolled out [Meraki] to the rest of our locations\u201d\u201419 in total. Full WiFi coverage, data analytics, and customer info ready to go out of the box.\nThe analytics were one of the reasons we chose Cisco Meraki.\n\nSenior Product Manager\nAccess points in each of Lone Star\u2019s restaurants are not only providing Internet access for patrons and POS systems, but also tracking valuable data for the business. The Cisco Meraki Connected Mobile Experience (CMX) captures tremendous amounts of customer data. \u201cThe analytics were one of the reasons we chose Cisco Meraki,\u201d says Macey, who plans on utilizing the information to create new menus, customize promotions, and interact with guests at a very high touch.\nPairing with Cloud4Wi\u2019s Volare platform made this WiFi solution a no-brainer. Cloud4Wi, a Cisco Meraki technology partner, capitalizes on Meraki products to create an enhanced guest WiFi experience. Their state-of-the-art solution, Volare, allows Lone Star to recognize return customers and personalize the WiFi experience to maximize returns. Using the Meraki location analytics information, Volare pinpoints customer locations in real time. \u2028\u2028Perhaps the most advantageous feature is the ability for Lone Star to count the number of people walking past each restaurant. Volare can determine how many pedestrians are strolling by, or lingering for a few minutes to check out the menu. All without needing visitors to actually connect to the WiFi!\nWith Meraki and Volare, Lone Star has drastically expanded their social media presence. Cataloguing customers with a captive portal welcome page, Lone Star saw the number of VIP members (frequent customers) spike in the first 90 days. This translates to massive increases in email subscribers, and as a result, more effective and targeted promotions.\nAs Lone Star continues to grow, so will the ability to connect and interact with customers in a personal and meaningful way. There\u2019s nowhere but forward with the tandem Meraki\u2013Volare solution; as technology migrates to the cloud, Lone Star will lead marketing efforts in the restaurant and retail space."

    "text": "From high school to vocational training, EUC Lilleb\u00e6lt offers programs for students looking to develop specialized skills, including architecture, computer engineering, process operating, blacksmithing, and more. Much of the curriculum requires access to online or digital content, making a robust network essential to learning.\nDistributed across five locations, the school\u2019s previous network operated on the aging 802.11g wireless standard and was difficult to manage. \u201cWe needed consultants to upgrade configurations on devices and so on, and not all of my people were able to manage the solution,\u201d explained Lars Juul, IT Manager at EUC Lilleb\u00e6lt. Juul wanted to provide the school with a complete technology overhaul including upgrading to the latest 802.11ac wireless standard. This would also provide better coverage for students and teachers who were connecting nearly 1,200 mobile devices to the wireless network daily.\nDuring the process of evaluating vendors, including HP and Aruba, Juul discovered the Cisco Meraki solution through his technology partner. He decided to attend one of the weekly webinars to learn more about the cloud-management platform and receive a free Meraki access point to test. Finding a product that provided simple management, while also offering deep visibility, was crucial considering the school\u2019s IT team consisted of just four people. Following the successful evaluation of the AP from the webinar, Juul chose to deploy 100 Cisco Meraki MR34 802.11ac APs \u201cWe chose Meraki because of the ease of use, the quality of the solution, and, of course, the price,\u201d said Juul.\nThe Meraki APs, installed at the network edge, connect seamlessly with the existing switch infrastructure, which is deployed in a star configuration. In a week where the school was closed, it took a single employee just three days to completely remove the old APs and deploy the new Meraki MR34 APs. \u201cIt was easy and pain-free,\u201d explained Juul. \u201cI actually enjoyed doing the entire wireless upgrade entirely alone.\u201d\nThe intuitive Cisco Meraki web-based interface provides the EUC Lilleb\u00e6lt team with the ability to configure up to 15 different SSIDs per network. This allows them to push custom settings to various user groups and to create SSIDs specifically for testing new features or configurations before making them live on the network. Currently there are 3 active SSIDs for guests, daytime students, and boarding students. Guests and boarding students have open access to the internet, but the IT team is able to enforce restrictions in dashboard to prevent abuse by denying access to the LAN and defining traffic shaping rules for peer-to-peer, social web, and photo sharing traffic. Conversely, users accessing the daytime student SSID are redirected to a captive portal where they are required to enter their Active Directory credentials to gain access to the network, including the LAN. On this SSID, Juul has configured Layer 3 firewall blocks and various traffic shaping rules.\n\u201cI personally like that Meraki has taken all the functions that are useful to us, and have made them very easy to access and use in a quick, meaningful way,\u201d explained Juul. \u201cThen they have taken the settings that only a few people wish to change and have preconfigured those settings for us in advance.\u201d\nThe tagging functionality in dashboard allows Juul\u2019s team to tag each Meraki AP with the type of access they want for that location. Using this feature, they can choose which SSIDs are broadcasted on the APs deployed in each area. Moreover, they can schedule when the SSIDs are broadcasted. For instance, for the daytime student SSID, the IT team has restricted access to daytime hours during the week, providing an additional level of security by eliminating access to internal resources during evening hours.\nThe ease of use with the Meraki solution ensures that I need to have zero, or near-zero, administration burden on a daily basis.\n\nIT Manager\nEUC Lilleb\u00e6lt provides services for numerous types of students and guests, meaning they have all types of devices accessing the network, from phones to tablets to gaming devices. This level of network exposure can be unsettling for IT teams; however, the Cisco Meraki MR34 APs have a dedicated security radio that continually scans the environment, classifying and containing potential threats like rogue SSIDs, packet floods, and malicious broadcasts. Juul\u2019s team can then assess the threat level and take whatever action they deem necessary, while knowing that the infrastructure is secure even outside of school hours.\nJuul and his team are able to keep an eye on their network from the dashboard by either diving into the fine-grained details on clients and configurations or by looking at the overview summary. The overview summary provides a historic look at the trends of usage, device types, area of heavy density, and clients. Using this information, they can identify where additional coverage is required and simply add an access point, create more fine-tuned SSID configurations, or adjust traffic shaping rules to balance bandwidth consumption. \u201cIt\u2019s working great,\u201d said Juul. \u201cWe can make changes to the network without anyone noticing, increasing speed and coverage.\u201d\nOne of the most appealing aspects of the new network has been the change in types of cases the IT team has been receiving. Before the upgrade, many of the cases being raised were related to something not working or a decrease in the overall performance of the wireless network. Now, they are receiving positive feedback about the improved coverage and the simplified Active Directory login process using the captive portal. Previously, only certain members of the team knew how to manage the network; now everyone on the IT staff is comfortable with the dashboard management interface and money is already being saved by not having to hire consultants for routine maintenance.\nThe troubleshooting tools that are integrated into the dashboard have allowed Juul to be proactive about his network maintenance. It has also given him the ability to identify potential problems in the network. For example, the RF spectrum analyzer revealed an issue with the school\u2019s alarm system and they were able to respond with configuration changes. Looking forward, the school is investigating Cisco Meraki Systems Manager for mobility management, as well as a more unified platform with Cisco Meraki switches. \u201cThe ease of use with the Meraki solution ensures that I need to have zero, or near-zero, administration burden on a daily basis,\u201d explained Juul."

Sterling Autobody has around 1050 employees and 60+ locations nationwide, ranging in size from 10,000-40,000 square feet.\nHowie Cheney, Vice President of IT, and Andy Corbett, Network Administrator, are part of a five man team tasked with ensuring the continued operation of the company\u2019s networking infrastructure, which supports everything from in-store repair machines to employee computers.\nHowever, Sterling Autobody\u2019s original WiFi solution failed to provide the visibility and control that Cheney and Corbett desired. In addition, it was actually two separate networks at each location \u2013 a traditional controller-based solution for the corporate network, and consumer-grade gear to support Sterling Autobody\u2019s specialized equipment, such as paint mixing machines and frame pulling machines, that require Internet access to download specifications unique to each vehicle.\n\u201cWe were running two Internet connections, one for corporate access and one for the machines, at each shop,\u201d Corbett explained. While this system ensured the security of the corporate network \u2013 important for corporate email, HR applications, and sales reports \u2013 it added cost and complexity. \u201cThere was no way to centrally manage all of the APs, and it was complex command line just to debug and manage each separate network. It was more hassle than it was worth.\u201d\nWhen Cheney and Corbett learned that the Cisco Meraki cloud managed wireless solution offered reliable connectivity, centralized management, and multiple SSIDs with a built-in firewall, they wanted to upgrade. \u201cWhen we discovered what Meraki could do, it was like \u2018Yes! We\u2019ll take it now!\u2019\u201d Corbett laughed.\nSterling Autobody worked with a technology partner to deploy one cloud managed access point (AP) per location. \u201cWe just shipped the units to the shops, and the deployment didn\u2019t take long at all,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cEach shop is shaped differently, so the local tech lead used the Meraki Stumbler to figure out the best placement, to make sure the signal reached the front office as well as the shop area.\u201d\nWith a few clicks in the web-based Cisco Meraki dashboard, Corbett created two SSIDs at each location: secure wireless for employees, utilizing Active Directory for authentication, and public wireless for guests and repair machines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to be able to split traffic on a single unit,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s great to offer guest access for our customers coming in with iPhones. At the same time, we can also now offer wireless access for traveling regional employees, whereas before we were running up a huge bill using air cards. Taking that off the table is saving us a tremendous amount of money.\u201d\nNow Cheney and Corbett keep an eye on their entire network from the Cisco Meraki dashboard, displaying it on a flat-screen television in their headquarters office. While they appreciate how cloud-based centralized management lets them see the network status at all of their locations, the granular visibility into each store\u2019s users, devices, and applications is perhaps even more meaningful. \u201cIn the past, we couldn\u2019t see where the traffic was going over the WiFi,\u201d said Cheney.\nIf we start to see a spike, we can drill down, see exactly where the traffic is coming from, troubleshoot, and make adjustments as necessary.\n\nNetwork Administrator\nWith Cisco Meraki\u2019s built-in client fingerprinting and Layer 7 application visibility, Corbett can quickly identify trends in bandwidth usage, like video or music streaming. \u201cWe found that our technicians were coming into work, firing up their iPhones, and streaming audio all day,\u201d said Corbett, explaining that this caused a network bottleneck. \u201cIn a couple of mouse clicks, we were able to set traffic shaping rules on the public SSID.\u201d This quickly blocked streaming and limited the amount of bandwidth that could be used for certain applications.\nNot only can they monitor long-term trends, they are able to respond instantly if they notice abnormal activity. \u201cIf we start to see a spike, we can drill down, see exactly where the traffic is coming from, troubleshoot, and make adjustments as necessary,\u201d Corbett said.\n\u201cWe can get a complete client list and see who is using up bandwidth at any point in time and then remotely blacklist them if needed,\u201d Cheney added.\nCisco Meraki\u2019s mobile device management solution facilitates on-the-fly troubleshooting as well. With Cisco Meraki\u2019s Systems Manager installed on virtually every shop computer \u2013 eight or nine at each location \u2013 Sterling Autobody\u2019s IT team can quickly access the devices remotely. They have visibility into what applications are on each computer, what needs to be updated, and where the devices are located; IT can then quickly resolve any problems they encounter.\nDay to day business is fast paced at each location. Orders are continually coming in, computers need up-to-date configurations, custom applications need monitoring, estimators and insurance companies need WiFi access, and customer service representatives need access to corporate assets. Fortunately, granular reporting, centralized management, and easy but powerful configuration options make operating the nationwide network simple for Cheney and Corbett.\n\u201cEven the \u2018Make a wish\u2019 feature is impressive,\u201d said Cheney. \u201cI made a wish and within a week, there was an update with that function!\u201d\nSterling Autobody Centers Gain Network Visibility, Provide Guest Access with Cisco Meraki WiFi"

The travel company is the fastest growing of its kind in Poland due to its use of advanced technology and innovative research methods to aggregate information when putting together packages for customers.\nWith 5 locations and 200 employees distributed throughout Poland, each of which requires access to central information to assist customers, eTravel\u2019s Vice President Janusz Zap\u0119cki knew he needed a system that would both unify the sites, as well as provide bullet-proof security. The previous solution was pieced together using equipment from different manufacturers and made exchanging information between locations difficult. There was little visibility into what was happening on the network and minimal protection if the network was compromised.\nJanusz Zap\u0119cki was drawn to the Cisco Meraki cloud-managed solution for numerous reasons, including the ease with which sites could communicate with each other and gain secure access to internal resources, as well as the built-in fault tolerance. \u201cWe chose Meraki because of its attractive licensing system,\u201d explained Janusz Zap\u0119cki, \u201cthe easy construction of a highly available network infrastructure, and the low cost of the configuration, management, and maintenance.\u201d As the entire infrastructure, wireless and wired, is viewed and managed via the same dashboard interface, the solution also reduced the complexity of adding other Meraki devices.\nComplete configuration and installation of Meraki 802.11ac APs and security appliances took less than two days of work. Warm spare redundancy using Virtual Routing Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) provides an added layer of protection if an MX device should go offline; no intervention is needed for the warm spare to take effect. In the event of a failure, a secondary MX will automatically take over its duties without disruption to services.\nWe chose Meraki because of its attractive licensing system, the easy construction of a highly available network infrastructure, and the low cost of the configuration, management, and maintenance\n\nVice President\neTravel, working with a partner who provides managed services for each of their locations, took advantage of the plug-and-play functionality of Meraki devices to deploy quickly. All configurations can be completed in the web-based dashboard before the devices arrive on-site, so the devices simply needed to be delivered and powered on to connect to the cloud and retrieve their settings. In just a few minutes, all of eTravel\u2019s devices were online and fully functional, equipped with content filtering, intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS) with Sourcefire\u2019s SNORT, malware detection, uplink bandwidth limits, and most importantly site-to-site VPN.\n\u201cThe network is deployed in a star topology with the headquarters at the center using an MX and WiFi devices,\u201d said Janusz Zap\u0119cki. \u201cMX devices are installed at each branch office and connected back to the headquarters with centralized access to applications and systems supporting the Call Center using Meraki Auto-VPN.\u201d The automatically provisioning site-to-site VPN built into the MX Security Appliances uses the power of the cloud to eliminate the difficulty of configuring and maintaining VPN connections. VPN connections are self-healing, meaning that in dynamic IP environments, the cloud continuously makes adjustments to ensure ongoing connectivity. Janusz Zap\u0119cki\u2019s managed service provider is able to monitor each of the tunnels with a real-time view of connectivity and overall health in the Meraki dashboard.\neTravel passes a variety of information across the network, from generic documents to traveler information, and it is imperative that every aspect of the network remains secure at all times. When Janusz Zap\u0119cki chose the Meraki solution, the ease with which security policy controls and content restrictions could be implemented at each branch was a huge factor. A wide range of devices used by employees and guests connect to the network daily, from computers and mobile devices to IP phones and other peripherals. \u201cSecuring the network infrastructure and servers within the company is crucial,\u201d said Janusz Zap\u0119cki. Regardless of the device type, Janusz Zap\u0119cki and the managed service provider can monitor specific actions and general trends using the network overview tools in the dashboard.\nThe numerous features integrated into the dashboard allow Janusz Zap\u0119cki and the managed service provider to be proactive with network management instead of reactive. They can take a quick look at the security report provided in the dashboard and quickly identify any security threats or simply have visibility into the ongoing effectiveness of their policies. They are also taking advantage of the automatic email alerts which allow them to choose which network activities require immediate notification. For instance, if an MX device fails over to its warm spare, an automatic alert with be sent to the managed service provider so they can immediately investigate and take action.\nFor eTravel, the Meraki solution provides reliable connections between sites, reduces risks posed by malware and viruses, limits bandwidth for recreational applications, restricts access to unwanted content, provides mission-critical security, and more. \u201cMeraki offers us a complete solution to build a network with a management and monitoring system that lowers the cost of ownership,\u201d said Janusz Zap\u0119cki. \u201cIn the field of networking and simple and functional management, it meets the needs of the majority of companies.\u201d"

Meticulously reproduced courses immerse golfers in an interactive training experience, while certified golf professionals provide consultation and lessons so that enthusiasts of all levels can shop\u2014and swing\u2014like the pros. With 20 locations across the United States and a diverse and evolving target demographic, IT Manager Michael Anderson saw an opportunity for the in-store technology experience to meet the needs of device-carrying visitors.\nPreviously, only four store locations were equipped with aging wireless gear. \u201cBut our needs were becoming more sophisticated,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe needed to support an influx of customer mobile devices and cutting edge golf technology, and our older networking hardware was unreliable.\u201d Headquartered in Roswell, Georgia with an IT team of five and a growing number of stores, PGA Tour Superstores required a scalable network solution to accommodate growth.\nFor a distributed premium retail network, Cisco Meraki wireless and switching was the perfect fit. Intuitive cloud-based management offers ideal visibility and control for a limited IT staff, and the PCI-compliant architecture provides the security that Anderson needed.\nIn a push to modernize the network, Anderson authorized the deployment of three Cisco Meraki MR wireless access points and one Cisco Meraki MS switch to each store location. From an IT perspective, it was important for Anderson to implement a solution that even non-technical individuals could operate when necessary. \u201cWith a small team, going onsite every time to fix an issue wasn\u2019t really an option,\u201d he said.\nIn-store Wi-Fi has definitely become an expectation by consumers. We were able to limit sports-related downloads and uploads via the dashboard to ensure that bandwidth was reserved for critical applications.\n\nIT Manager\nPlug and play hardware eliminated the time-intensive installation associated with conventional networking infrastructures, and the ability to clone network configurations enabled seamless onboarding of each store to the network.\nThe PGA Tour Superstore customer experience is intended to facilitate meaningful and informative interactions, allowing potential buyers to make direct inquiries to brand specialists. To accommodate this, PGA Tour Superstores provide kiosks for brand representatives, many of whom leverage digital technology to increase customer engagement. Providing a tactile, user-driven experience is important to these on-site specialists.\n\u201cVendors were always asking to connect to wireless so they could download presentations and videos at their kiosks, but we didn\u2019t want them to overwhelm the available bandwidth,\u201d Anderson explained. \u201cWe were able to completely eliminate this concern with a couple of mouse clicks on the Meraki dashboard.\u201d\nAnderson utilized several critical features to ensure that in-store bandwidth was never saturated by vendor activity. First, he activated an SSID specifically for vendors to ensure temporary access to the network without compromising additional guest traffic. He then implemented time-based policies to dictate the hours when the SSID would be available. \u201cI was able to apply restrictive SSID limits on uploading and downloading, making set-up easy for vendors when they needed it, and allocating bandwidth more efficiently when they didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was seamless.\u201d\nIn addition to enabling experiential marketing through reliable connectivity, Anderson also realized that improving the shopping experience with guest access to Wi-Fi was necessity. \u201cIn-store Wi-Fi has definitely become an expectation by consumers,\u201d he said.\nAt the PGA Tour Superstore headquarters in Roswell, Anderson was able to create and hide SSIDs as necessary, ensuring that the network was properly segmented for particular user groups. Guests are able to access an SSID with scheduled availability during business hours, and employees can access secure corporate SSIDs. \u201cWe were able to limit sports-related downloads and uploads via the dashboard to ensure that bandwidth was reserved for critical applications,\u201d he said. \u201cWith employees frequently on the move, customizing a mobile SSID enabling secure access to email made for an easy, secure network.\u201d\nLooking forward, Anderson plans to more heavily utilize the dashboard\u2019s robust reporting capabilities to guide marketing decisions. \u201cThe Cisco Meraki solution enables enhanced guest experiences while delivering rich intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to analyze long-term customer data to determine how much traffic specific markets see.\u201d The PGA Tour Superstore marketing team intends to tie store location visitation frequency to their rewards program, and implement customized splash pages as part of the customer log-in experience.\n\u201cOverall, cloud management has created endless possibilities for us to innovate how we use our network,\u201d Anderson noted. \u201cThe best part is, you don\u2019t have to be a high-level network engineer to figure things out.\u201d\n\nRetail Case Study & TCO Analysis: Victra\nPCI Compliance Whitepaper\nMeraki MX for Retail"

JBG is a mixed-use specialist that invests almost exclusively in urban-infill, transit-oriented developments in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. With a 30.2 million square foot portfolio spread across D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, JBG is a large and growing player in the D.C. real estate market.\nOver the past several years, JBG\u2019s portfolio nearly doubled in size and continued to grow, adding properties and employees at an ever-increasing pace. By 2016, over 700 employees at 72 sites were online, yet they were still relying on legacy network infrastructure that had remained relatively unchanged for nearly a decade. A key limitation was the risk posed by wireless networks at remote sites; because there was no way to remotely monitor internet usage or potential security threats most sites lacked even basic Wi-Fi.\nFor SVP and Director of IT Michael Rogers and his nimble team of eight, maintaining the network was frequently challenged by a combination of resource and time constraints. Deployments were inconsistent across devices and platforms, which meant each site was very difficult to manage. Any network or device changes, regardless of whether they were simple or complex, had to be done manually. Configurations were made over SSH or HTTP connections, which couldn\u2019t always be configured remotely. This was a challenge for Roger\u2019s team since they oversee everything from network infrastructure and security to software and desktop applications, to help desk support across all 70 locations.\nJBG was going to continue to scale, and Rogers knew the network would need to scale along with it. He started considering solutions that could be deployed in varying environments and were also easy for his lean team to manage remotely. He sought a solution that was more scalable, reliable, and secure than their existing environment. According to Rogers, \u201cCisco Meraki\u2019s single-pane-of-glass management and complete hardware solution made this an easy choice for us.\u201d Each Meraki device is managed through a cloud-based dashboard, increasing visibility and control over the network as a whole.\n\u201cMeraki had the potential to cut down setup and deployment time, as well as provide an easier, more unified management experience. Now, we have a standard network deployment at all of our sites and can manage everything from a single console,\u201d explained Rogers. \u201cNone of the other solutions we considered offered such a complete and easy-to-use solution, which is critical for such a lean staff.\u201d\nRogers and his team liked the cloud-based approach because it simplified their deployment experience. Utilizing the templating and cloning features for Meraki devices, which applies an appliance configuration, or template, to a series of devices, the IT team was able to pre-configure all the devices before they were even out of the box. The devices were then shipped to each of the sites for local staff members to simply plug in and set up on their own. This allowed JBG to deploy Meraki MX Security Appliances and APs across 55 sites within just six weeks; the entire process was painless and quick.\nToday, all JBG properties have VPNs back to the main office and wireless networks for non-VPN traffic. Access policies are applied to both corporate and guest SSIDs, alleviating previous concerns around wireless security. Content-filtering and traffic-shaping rules are applied to these access policies, as are malware protections that the IT team can monitor remotely.\nIn addition to security appliances and APs, JBG has Meraki switches deployed at a number of sites that make use of the extra port density. Alerts in the dashboard enable the team to be more proactive when configuring the network. Compared to the previous switches installed, the Meraki MS switches provide greater visibility into the network, especially for device management. With Meraki, the IT team can trace devices all the way to the specific ports they\u2019re connected to. Similarly, the team is able to make changes more quickly, updating VLANs and power cycling ports with just the click of a button.\nAs all the devices are managed through a single console, JBG now has a \u201cstandardized network that is updated and maintained with minimal oversight, giving the IT team more time to focus on other projects in the queue,\u201d as Rogers describes it. And it\u2019s \u201cgreat to provide employees with extra networking functionalities that weren\u2019t previously there.\u201d This is particularly important for Rogers\u2019 team, which is responsible for making sure the organization runs smoothly and efficiently.\nWhen thinking about future plans for JBG, Rogers is excited by the new Meraki MC phones and MV security cameras because they offer additional visibility into the full networking stack. Meraki \u201cis a one-stop-shop that allows us to deploy standardized, inexpensive technology to remote sites,\u201d which enables the team to support more sites faster with fewer resources.\nMeraki helps JBG continue to scale their business and services without requiring additional IT staffing resources or an overextended budget. Rodgers loves how easy it has all been. \u201cWith Meraki,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can do so much more.\u201d"

    "text": "BQ is a leading European technology company. Smartphones, tablets, 3D printers and PrintBots are a few of their products. With offices in Europe and Asia, over 1,200 employees, and a product presence in over 50 countries, BQ\u2019s vision is to create and distribute technology that educates, inspires, open doors, breaks down barriers, and is accessible for everyone. BQ also considers itself to be an educational company, dedicated to helping people understand technology, encouraging its use, and inspiring others to create it.\nWith BQ\u2019s philosophy revolving around a commitment to education in technology, the Do-It-Yourself philosophy, and the Open Source Initiative, Director of IT Mario Fern\u00e1ndez wanted a powerful network infrastructure which reflected these ideals and would support the company\u2019s on-going global initiatives. \u201cWe realised it was necessary for all teams to be connected on a single network and to manage them from a single location. In an increasingly international company, we needed a high level of flexibility and the capacity fo customisation.\u201d\nBQ chose Cisco Meraki as the ideal solution for optimising the management of its entire network, enabling them to configure the network easily and tailor it to their needs. According to Mario Fern\u00e1ndez, \u201cgetting new BQ offices up and running is now extremely easy thanks to Meraki. Centralised cloud management enables us to control our entire network from a single panel, without having to develop a system ourselves. It has already been done, so all we have to do is use it\u201d.\nUsing the centralised dashboard for unified management, BQ deployed Meraki Security Appliances, Switches, and Access Points to their various locations. Without having to be on-site, the IT team can manage each of the remote locations via the dashboard, have visibility into network usage, and implement changes as needed.\nMonitoring the use of broadband in each network enables us to act rapidly to prevent any loss of service. In a matter of clicks, we can block a user, apply a content filtering policy, and limit the broadband for different applications.\nDirector of IT\n\n\u00a0\nUsing the automatic site-to-site VPN built-into the MX Security Appliances, Mario is able to connect each of the separate locations together. He can even link pre-existing, non-Meraki VPN peers into the same network, thereby making the sharing of resources between sites seamless. The self-healing nature of the VPN connections on the MX devices means they will stay updated in dynamic IP\nenvironments. Additionally, BQ is using the traffic shaping and per-client bandwidth limits to regulate how the network is being used, enabling fair network usage amongst all of its employees.\nTo ensure the security of the network, Mario has implemented a series of security measures, including malware detection, intrusion detection and prevention powered by Sourcefire\u2019s SNORT technology, and even content filtering. Each of these features is easily enabled with the simple click of a button or by selecting categories to block, like adult content, phishing, and hacking. Aside from preventing access to certain content, the MX can prioritise certain types of mission-critical traffic and even pair VLAN routing with more granular group policies. These group policies are designed to provide more customised settings for particular users, devices, and even traffic types.\nThe Meraki Layer 2 and Layer 3 access switches provide BQ with per-port customisation depending on the individual needs of each locations. Access policies can be enabled on each port which requires users to enter their 802.1X credentials for wired access. Due to the unified dashboard, Mario and the IT team can seamlessly move through the dashboard, clicking into each port and identifying the device or Meraki access point connected, providing greater insight into how each network is used throughout the greater organisation.\nFrom the network core to the end user devices, the IT team can have complete control. Whether employee, guest, or vendor, users are routed to one of 15 SSIDs per network that has been completely customised for their group. Mario has then defined per-device bandwidth restrictions, Layer 7 firewall limitations, and traffic shaping rules tailored to the company\u2019s requirements. One of the greatest benefits of the Meraki solution is that all of these configurations require simple selections from drop-down menus or fill in the blank. The IT team does not need additional training nor do they need to utilise complex command line to achieve their results.\nBQ is in full expansion, which means opening new offices. Thanks to Meraki, BQ can expand its network without any problems and can continue to manage each of the distributed sites from one location. This centralisation allows for greater efficiency and effectiveness, as well as enabling each of the various offices to share information quickly and securely.\nDirector of IT Mario Fern\u00e1ndez explains, \u201cthe security policies can be used as templates and tailored to each network. On adding a new device to that network, it is instantly configured\u201d. The Meraki interface is highly detailed and intuitive, and includes tools for supervision, remote diagnostics, and detection of potential incidents, all of which enables BQ to detect any issues with ease. Together with its Anti-malware system, this guarantees the security of BQ\u2019s activities and protects against external threats. \u201cMonitoring the use of broadband in each network enables us to act rapidly to prevent any loss of service. In a matter of clicks, we can block a user, apply a content filtering policy, and limit the broadband for different applications,\u201d Mario concludes."

    "text": "Situated just outside the island of Mallorca\u2019s capital, City of Palma, the beaches of Playa de Palma are one of Europe\u2019s most popular vacation destinations; the nearby airport of Palma floods the area with more than a million tourists every season. However, high data roaming charges often dissuade visitors from using their mobile devices while vacationing, preventing them from learning about special events or unique cultural opportunities promoted online.\nIn an effort to provide tourists with the best possible experience, the City of Palma began looking at new concepts that would provide a more welcoming technological environment for tourists. As a member of the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (RECI), it was crucial for the city to create a framework that built upon the idea of Smart Cities and developed solutions that could be replicated in other cities.\nAfter reviewing several ideas, the city partnered with MallorcaWiFi to deliver accessible WiFi using the Cisco Meraki cloud networking solution, which provides easy-to-use management of distributed networks via a centralized dashboard. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trusting the Cisco Meraki solution for six years and chose it here because we wanted to provide the best possible service: management, capacity, scalability, and adoption of new features,\u201d remarked Mauricio Socias, MallorcaWiFi CEO.\nMallorcaWiFi\u2019s proposal stipulated that they would not only manage the daily operation of the entire network, but would also carry the complete investment for the project. Once deployed, the city and tourists would benefit from the wireless at no additional cost. MallorcaWiFi\u2019s cost return would be provided through advertising contracts with local businesses that would then run advertisements and commercials using MallorcaWiFi\u2019s custom application platform. Wireless service for end users is completely free.\nWorking with the SmartOffice of Palma, a department created by the City of Palma to supervise the project, and the Playa de Palma Consortium, an organization which oversees sustainable city development and the installation of WiFi devices in public areas, MallorcaWiFi began installing Cisco Meraki access points. \u201cThe four-year project consists of three phases,\u201d explained Socias. \u201cThe complete planned installation will use more than 100 Meraki outdoor APs and several Meraki indoor 802.11n and 802.11ac APs.\u201d\nPhase One of the project, spanning an area of 5 km along the first line of Palma beaches, was completed in just three months. \u201cThe installation process with Cisco Meraki was very easy and fast,\u201d said Socias. \u201cMost of the time was spent on the strategic placement of equipment on 15 meter tall lampposts and working on partnerships to place APs on buildings and other structures where service would be provided to the most users.\u201d In areas where the APs would be exposed to extreme environmental conditions, such as humidity, salt, and high temperatures, rugged Cisco Meraki outdoor APs were used. Depending on deployment location and available infrastructure, APs are connected either via Ethernet cable or through an automatic, self-configuring mesh network.\nWe\u2019ve been trusting the Cisco Meraki solution for six years and chose it here because we wanted to provide the best possible service: management, capacity, scalability, and adoption of new features.\nMallorcaWiFi CEO\nMallorcaWiFi is taking full advantage of the 15 different SSIDs available on every Cisco Meraki network. Each local business, including hotels and cafes, that chose to purchase advertising contracts on the wireless is assigned an SSID with a unique authentication method. Some of the companies have implemented custom splash pages with a walled garden, so users must first watch a video or click through an ad to access the free wireless. Other companies with social media pages have opted for users to authenticate to their SSID via Facebook WiFi login, which enables clients to \u201ccheck in\u201d to the location to access the free wireless. Both options provide increased brand awareness for the companies, either through targeted ads on the splash pages or by promoting the business to users\u2019 social groups.\nOnce logged in, each public SSID has been specifically configured with per-client bandwidth limits in order to provide the optimal user experience for visitors. Using the built-in management features and Layer 7 fingerprinting on every device, MallorcaWiFi restricts access to specific groups of applications which heavily consume bandwidth, including peer-to-peer, file sharing, and gaming. However, other applications that tourists rely upon are prioritized, including social web and photo sharing, email, and access to both the city\u2019s and MallorcaWiFi\u2019s websites.\nUsing the Cisco Meraki dashboard, admins have quick visibility into the network. This visibility provides valuable information into where visitors are accessing the network and what applications are being used. \u201cThe latest features like location analytics and integration with Facebook are simply killer,\u201d Socias exclaimed. Using this information, the city can organize public safety as needed or customize messages for guests to promote tourist sites or cultural events. MallorcaWiFi is also creating smart apps for tourists, as well as businesses, to ensure that tourists always have the best experience and up-to-date information.\nWith only two technicians and two account managers from MallorcaWiFi ensuring the network\u2019s daily operation, the centralized management provided by the Cisco Meraki dashboard is key. The team\u2019s work is facilitated by numerous built-in features that assist in providing a reliable and secure network environment. For example, RF optimization automatically ensures strong performance on each AP in MallorcaWiFi\u2019s highly dense wireless environment, maximizing the network performance, while Air Marshall detects and neutralizes wireless threats like rogue SSIDs and malicious broadcasts.\nShould there be an issue with the network, automatic alerts are sent to the admins. Using the web-based dashboard, they can quickly analyze the potential problem and troubleshoot remotely, without the need to go on-site. \u201cWe work with the dashboard in real time, anywhere, at any time,\u201d notes Socias. \u201cIt is simple and very effective.\u201d\nWhile the ultimate goal of this project is to solidify the Playa de Palma as a Smart Destination and provide visitors with services they may not find at other tourist destinations, only half of the network\u2019s capacity is dedicated to this objective. \u201cThe Playa de Palma Consortium,\u201d explained Socias, \u201chas access to 50% of the network for coordination with public administrations, law enforcement, research with the university, and more.\u201d In order to provide this seamless segmentation within the same network, group policies have been created within the Cisco Meraki management dashboard that give certain groups, like law enforcement, unrestricted bandwidth usage and the ability to bypass splash pages when authenticating to the network.\nSince the deployment of the first phase of the project, the City of Palma has seen a steady increase in daily connections, initially at 3,500 daily connections using 1.5 TB of traffic and surging to more than 25,000 daily users now. This influx in wireless usage has benefitted the city in numerous ways, including increases in tourism at cultural sites, awareness of tourist presence throughout the city, and overall public works and safety. Additionally, the placement of the Cisco Meraki wireless solution along the beaches of Playa de Palma provides opportunities for local companies to develop new business practices, increasing revenue and improving visitor experience.\nThe next phases of the project will cover two more expanses of beach and areas of the town, covering more than 1,000 hectares of land with an expected 10 million users per year. \u201cInnovation, adaptation, and trust were important considerations for us when choosing a wireless solution,\u201d said Socias. \u201cThe implementation of the Cisco Meraki network has seen unprecedented success in these areas. 95% of users accessing the network are tourists using smartphones, with more than 25,000 unique daily users connected!\u201d"

    "text": "With 42 branch locations and over 1,800 associates scattered across the United States, Andrew McInerney, Data Network and Voice Manager at Penn Mutual, oversees a challenging network. Previously, the mutual life insurance company used a traditional hub-and-spoke VPN service through a telecom carrier to support their distributed network. Over time, however, associates increasingly relied on internet-hosted applications for everyday tasks, which slowed down the network.\n\u201cThere was a lot of latency,\u201d McInerney explained. \u201cThe growing use of cloud-based applications in the financial industry meant our network needed to get up to speed.\u201d Low speeds and high costs, as well as the bandwidth implications of having all data go through headquarters, soon outweighed the benefit of having a fully managed service.\nMcInerney and his team began looking for alternative networking solutions that they could manage in-house.\nMcInerney sought a networking solution with a split-tunnel VPN model to reduce strain on bandwidth at the home office. In addition, he hoped to connect the previously wired-only field offices using a wireless solution, while still maintaining network visibility.\nWith a staff of only three network administrators at the home office in Horsham, PA, he needed proven security to protect Penn Mutual\u2019s confidential data, while providing an easy-to-manage interface for his lean IT team. \u201cIt goes without saying that security, in terms of controlling assets and controlling access to wired and wireless networks, is critical no matter which vertical you are in, but especially in the financial industry,\u201d McInerney said.\nWhen McInerney first learned about cloud networking, he realized that the Cisco Meraki web-based dashboard would allow his team to manage all 42 sites from headquarters without requiring extensive training or time spent on deployment or management.\nI looked into it and saw that Cisco Meraki captured everything we were trying to do,\u201d he said. He quickly set up a test lab with one Cisco Meraki MX security appliance, one MS switch, and two MR access points. The trial worked flawlessly. \u201cWe had to pinch ourselves: \u2018Is this really that simple?\u2019\n\nData Network and Voice Manager\nUpon deploying Meraki solutions to the remaining branch locations, McInerney\u2019s team simply cloned the test lab device configurations to the new devices from the dashboard. \u201cWe set everything up ourselves, though the Meraki support team helped us get started,\u201d he said. \u201cCisco Meraki offers an incredible support channel; it\u2019s refreshing. As an IT manager, it\u2019s usually painful to get help, but in this case, it wasn\u2019t painful\u2014it was just a quick phone call away. That\u2019s very important to me.\u201d\nMcInerney chose a staggered deployment to facilitate the company\u2019s transition away from the telecom carrier. Today, about halfway through their deployment, Penn Mutual has 22 MX security appliances, two MX400s at HQ, and one MX80 or MX90 at each field location. The company also has several MS42/P switches and MR24 access points at each office. McInerney noted that cloud networking makes it easy to deploy as many devices as needed in a scalable way, while the zero-touch configuration plug-and-play hardware increased deployment flexibility. \u201cNow it\u2019s like clockwork\u2014everything is working together perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a tremendous amount of success.\u201d\nIn particular, McInerney praised the MX Security Appliance, which, with auto-provisioning site-to-site VPN, securely connects Penn Mutual\u2019s HQ and branch offices without manual VPN configuration. This site-to-site VPN solution also facilitated massive savings in connectivity costs, as Penn Mutual moved from an expensive T1 VPB hub-and-spoke model to using 50Mbps DSL broadband where available.\nThe MXs at each branch also provide Layer 7 visibility, allowing McInerney to isolate and identify unauthorized platforms for remediation. Layer 3 firewall rules ensure VLAN separation, while Layer 7 firewall rules deny access to specific applications. \u201cThe MX gives us visibility into our field networks that we never had before,\u201d McInerney said. That visibility includes content filtering to block categories, including nudity and\nSPAM sources, and allows McInerney to easily limit uplink configuration as well as per-device and per-SSID bandwidth. Additionally, specific URLs are blocked (e.g., xfinitytv.net) and whitelisted (e.g., pennmutual.com).\nWe came from an environment where our field offices had legacy layer 2 switches with minimal visibility. Having layer 7 visibility is incredible. It\u2019s clear to anyone who is viewing the dashboard what is going on at each port.\n\nData Network and Voice Manager\nWhereas associates were previously limited to wired connections, the Meraki APs now provide Wi-Fi at all offices, which subsequently provides greater mobility to Penn Mutual associates. With just a few clicks in the dashboard, McInerney configured two SSIDs across all locations. The corporate SSID is always available and securely connects clients to the LAN via WPA2-PSK authentication. The guest network, primarily intended for office visitors, uses a customized click-through splash page, and pushes all guest clients to a specific VLAN, isolating them from connecting directly to the LAN. Furthermore, the guest SSID is only available during office hours, Monday-Friday from 8 am to 6 pm.\nThe Meraki MS switches in each branch further secure the network. Penn Mutual uses enterprise security features that are easy to deploy at scale, such as 802.1X port security. The MS switches also simplify network management. Device fingerprinting ensures the IT team can find and identify specific clients, irrespective of which switch or port they are connected to, while virtual stacking allows the IT team to configure ports across multiple sites with just a few clicks and enables them to search by tag or by port, configure trunk vs. access port types, set up native VLANs, and more.\n\u201cWe came from an environment where our field offices had legacy Layer 2 switches with minimal visibility. Having Layer 7 visibility is incredible. It\u2019s clear to anyone who is viewing the dashboard what is going on at each port,\u201d McInerney explained.\nToday, Penn Mutual has a secure network with reliable access for associates and guests. McInerney and his team also boast increased network speeds via traffic-shaping, bandwidth and filtering rules, and WAN optimization. They have complete visibility into clients, devices, and applications on the network. \u201cThe reporting feature for management is very insightful and detailed. With the dashboard, you literally have the ability to see your entire network at once,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe whole project was huge and exciting, but all everyone sees now is a network that is so much faster and easier to navigate.\u201d\n\n(1.544-4.632 Mbps Ethernet)\n\n\nMeraki Campus Deployment Guide\nActive Directory Integration Whitepaper"

The students use the Internet for research, watch educational videos on YouTube, and perform dissections online.\n\u201cIt was clear we needed more capacity, more reliability, and a better way to quickly view what was happening on the wireless network,\u201d Maschino said. As the only IT person on staff, he knew he also needed a solution that was easy to manage.\nBenton Community Schools in Van Horne, Iowa includes a high school, a middle school, and four elementary schools, and supports 1600 students and 170 teachers and staff. The schools previously relied on consumer-grade access points (APs), but Maschino said the APs were unreliable, had insufficient capacity, and had to be managed individually.\nAfter receiving a recommendation for Meraki from Infrastructure Technology Solutions, Maschino tested Meraki at the high school. He was so pleased with Meraki\u2019s ease of deployment and intuitive centralized management, he quickly expanded to the rest of the schools and deployed 24 Meraki access points in total.\nThe deployment process was straightforward, Maschino said. A walkthrough of each building gave him a general idea of where to place the APs, and deploying each AP took less than five minutes.\n\u201cThe configuration is all automated, so I don\u2019t have to do anything besides plug it in,\u201d he said. \u201cEach access point even knows which channels it can use relative to the other access points.\u201d\nOnce the APs were in place, Maschino used the web-based Meraki dashboard to check usage and add additional APs to high-use areas. \u201cI use the dashboard all the time to view what is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see that my access points at every location are working, what devices are attached to each AP, and which areas get the most use. It\u2019s a fabulous tool \u2013 it gives me a lot of control.\u201d\nI can see that my access points at every location are working, what devices are attached to each AP, and which areas get the most use.

    "text": "Technology at northern California\u2019s Oakland Unified School District has fundamentally changed over the past few years and is continuing to evolve and meld into every aspect of learning. Moving from a pencil and paper model to an online technology model, which promotes fast-paced education and collaboration, is one of the key motivators spurring schools to rethink how they structure their curriculum.\nOakland USD\u2019s Chief Technology Officer John Krull is well aware of just how quickly changes in technology and education can happen. At Oakland USD, the 2013-2014 school year marked the initial implementation of the new Common Core testing standards, a state-mandated online learning and testing initiative setting standards for mathematics and English. To support this initiative, Krull needed a network that could support hundreds of students simultaneously taking online tests. \u201cI came on board in August 2013 and Common Core testing started in April 2014,\u201d explained Krull. \u201cWe needed to move and we needed to make a decision fast.\u201d\nOakland Unified School District provides educational services to over 37,000 students annually and is comprised of more than 120 K-12 schools and child developments centers. When Krull joined the district, he discovered that while the previous network was functional, it was only meant to support the laptop of the occasional roaming teacher. Its intended use was not for classrooms of students using mobile devices for collaboration, and certainly not for supporting hundreds of students accessing online tests all at once.\nKrull knew that major technology changes were needed in order to successfully meet the April 2014 go-live date for the first round of online testing. Before the 2013 upgrade, each site had varying levels of wireless infrastructure, as well as varying quantities and ages of mobile devices. The result was that each site generally lacked both continuity in technology offerings and the ability to support them. \u201cThere was inequality across the sites when facing online testing,\u201d Krull explained. \u201cWe had 10,000 computers to use for testing, but the computers were all different makes and models. The network had the same problem.\u201d Students and staff had been using an aging computer system to integrate technology into the classroom, but it was not robust enough to meet the new education requirements.\nKrull had heard about the Meraki cloud-managed solution at a previous job and decided to pilot the Meraki MR34 802.11ac access points. \u201cWe started by putting them on the walls at one of the high schools, and it was so successful that we pulled the trigger and got 300 APs,\u201d said Krull. Today, the network has grown to almost 3,500 MR 34s.\nWith only 5 of 34 IT staff dedicated to network operation, Krull\u2019s mantra of \u201cequitable, supportable, and standardized\u201d is crucial to maintaining daily operations. A recent award in federal funding helped fulfill this philosophy by financing the initial purchase of Meraki APs, as well as 10,000 new Chromebooks. Conforming all school sites to a model of mobile Chromebooks carts with a Meraki AP attached provided the equality and standardization Krull desired. The simplicity and power of the cloud-based management for the APs provided the small network staff with the ability to easily support and manage the wireless. \u201cThe whole Meraki dashboard turned into our help desk dashboard. It\u2019s had a huge impact on the network and has shown us weak points that people had been putting up with,\u201d explained Krull.\nIt\u2019s so easy to use. In a few weeks we added 10,000 devices to the network and 300 Meraki APs, roughly doubling the end user computing devices and significantly adding to the wireless \u2014 all without hiring a single extra person.\n\nChief Technology Officer\nFrom an end user perspective, the district\u2019s IT team has begun surveying staff, students, and principals about their experiences. The results have been extremely positive and have even been accompanied by pictures of excited students and rich-technology usage in the classroom. \u201cTypically, end users have extremes, they either love or hate wireless,\u201d Krull noted. \u201cThe Meraki devices provide the speed and improved user experience. It just works and people are happy.\u201d\nUnifying the district under a single network model drastically reduced the amount of time and energy exerted by the IT team on a daily basis. All of the sites are connected in a hub and spoke architecture to a metropolitan WAN which routes all traffic back to a main data center, running alongside a redundant backup. The data center houses district services including storage, servers, firewall, and security. Depending on location size, the network connection comes in to Cisco switches in the MDF which are then connected to smaller IDFs as needed. The district is working towards standardizing on Cisco Catalyst 3k switches at each site, an upgrade the IT team is excited about, given the amount of control they provided. Krull explained that simplification of the network is critical in a district the size of Oakland USD, \u201cand even though Cisco switches can be complex, the integration with Meraki wireless helps make them easy.\u201d\nThe IT team created the initial AP configuration in the Meraki dashboard and simply installed the Meraki APs on Chromebook carts, where they downloaded their configurations once plugged in. Along with the Meraki 802.11ac AP mounted on each Chromebook cart, the plan is to also place a Meraki AP in every classroom and workspace. APs on carts will be dedicated to testing and intensive online use, complete with their own Chromebook SSID with Meraki DHCP enabled, allowing students to authenticate via 802.1X with Meraki RADIUS. Meanwhile, APs in classrooms will broadcast a different SSID and will be used for daily classroom activity, including research, collaboration, and application usage. \u201cWe want to have the high density coverage on Chromebook carts for those that are testing and another set of APs for non-testing, broadcasting a different SSID,\u201d Krull explained. \u201cWe want a highly engaging, blended learning environment streaming video, while also testing.\u201d\nUpgrading to Meraki wireless has had a massive impact on the network, empowering network engineers and technicians to actively troubleshoot issues, as well as optimize the network space between the WAN and the end user. Before the Meraki deployment, visibility into the network consisted of merely being able to see whether a device was online or not; now network engineers are providing first and second tier help desk techs with read-only access and tools to diagnose many of the network issues. The Cisco Meraki dashboard is also providing insight into Oakland USD\u2019s downstream issues, including lost packets and misconfigured DNS servers. Overall, the end user experience has greatly improved with increased speeds, WAN optimization, and improved security.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to use,\u201d Krull said. \u201cIn a few weeks we added 10,000 devices to the network and 300 Meraki APs, roughly doubling the end user computing devices and significantly adding to the wireless \u2014 all without hiring a single extra person,\u201d said Krull.\nShortly after the first round of Common Core testing concluded, California\u2019s state superintendent of public instruction requested a conference with Oakland USD to assess the results of the program. The discussion included a panel of principals, staff, and students and was focused on the effectiveness of the testing standards, ease of use, and overall thoughts. But there were only a few brief minutes spent talking about the wireless. \u201cIt was incredible. Here is the person who decided to do online testing in the state and we weren\u2019t talking about bad bandwidth, computers breaking, or slowness,\u201d explained Krull. \u201cInstead we were talking about kids being engaged in the testing. The fact that the network worked flawlessly during testing was an impromptu measure of success.\u201d"

    "text": "Brookstone is a nationwide retailer specializing in innovative, unique, and useful consumer goods paired with an experiential shopping experience. The Brookstone team is dedicated to consistently improving the shopping experience for their customers, and they are able to focus their efforts on this high-level mission with the reliable, no-nonsense network that Meraki cloud managed wireless and switching solutions provide.\nDon Gingras, Chief Architect of Security and Infrastructure for Brookstone, and his team turned to Meraki after encountering managerial challenges with their previous networking solution. Prior to Meraki, Brookstone relied on a third party vendor to install and manage their WiFi network. \u201cWe increasingly became more and more frustrated at the lack of visibility on our end. We only became aware of problems when the stores called us about it,\u201d said Kyle Masters, the Help Desk Manager for Brookstone.\nRock-solid WiFi coverage had become increasingly important to the Brookstone store experience, where associates and customers required access to detailed product information for the company\u2019s thousands of products. Brookstone\u2019s former WiFi network proved unable keep up with this increased need for reliability and traffic capacity. In the time it took a store associate to report a network issue, the customer\u2019s shopping experience had already been compromised; that wasn\u2019t good enough for Brookstone.\nThe team began looking for a new solution that would offer the visibility and managerial abilities they desired. They did a proof of concept with the Meraki cloud managed solution, and \u201cfell in love with the Meraki technology, especially the ease of use, accessibility, and how simple it was to set up,\u201d shared Doug Reczko, Operational VP of IT at Brookstone. In each Brookstone store, there is now one MS 8-port Switch with a MR32 802.11ac Access Point wired into it. From there, depending on the size of the store, several other MR32 APs connect via mesh to provide fast and seamless connectivity for all business users, without having to cable the entire store.\nWith nearly 225 stores across the United States, the simple, scalable mass-management inherent to the Meraki platform is a necessity for Brookstone. The team is able to log into their Meraki management dashboard and instantly see all of their locations, learn which sites are running smoothly and which sites need attention, and drill down into specific devices for further insight and troubleshooting. With custom role-based admin functionality, Brookstone can decide which team members are granted full permissions or read only privileges in this powerful dashboard. Since all hardware is managed through the cloud, this deep visibility and management is accessible from anywhere in the world.\nMy goal as an executive is to bring our services to a higher level and do it better, faster, and for less; the Meraki tools allow us to do that.\n\nOperational VP of IT\nWhen initially deploying their Meraki wireless APs, the Brookstone team put together basic installation instructions and shipped the gear to third-party field technicians. The team preconfigured all the devices in the Meraki dashboard, so the field technicians needed only to plug in the devices and they instantly downloaded their unique settings from the cloud. The field technicians were then able to perform site surveys with the tools built directly into Meraki access points, such as RF optimization and heat mapper.\nAs soon as the APs were plugged in, the Brookstone IT team could monitor how they were performing through the dashboard and make any changes they desired. \u201cThe quality of the equipment was far and away above the quality of the equipment that was there previously. I think that it just covered better, and the fact that we were able to know that it covered better really cemented our comfort level with the purchase. That was a big improvement for the WiFi in the stores,\u201d shared Kyle. \u201cOnce we installed the Meraki equipment, you could see the wheels start to turn in employees\u2019 heads with the possibilities this opened. They\u2019re using the WiFi joyfully now,\u201d added John.\nTo deploy their fleet of Meraki switches, Brookstone relied on the same third party technicians to install and wire their distributed stores according to their instructions. They asked the technicians to leave open-ended cables in specific switch ports, so store managers could later plug in their new credit card pin pad machines. Using Meraki port-level visibility, the team was able to see if the correct cables were plugged into the correct ports, all the way from headquarters. \u201cThis saved significant hours of aggravation at the store level. Rather than just assuming the cables were there and waiting for store managers to report issues, we could go to the installation team and show them what was missing,\u201d said John. \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t do that cable test, we would have had multiple stores on go-live day that would have found there was no place for them to plug their equipment into. All the scheduling, all the software coordination leading up to that day would have been wasted.\u201d Thanks to the plug-and-play functionality and remote management capabilities, the entire Meraki deployment took only four weeks total.\nThe deep visibility Meraki provides across all product lines has helped Brookstone save significant time and money. Rather than waiting for store employees to report connectivity issues, the team can monitor all their equipment and use built-in troubleshooting tools to proactively resolve any issues. The intelligent topology mapping features on the switches and live tools, such as packet capture, have even helped Brookstone troubleshoot their third party firewall. \u201cHaving a way to prove everything is good or if things need to be corrected before we have problems is just priceless,\u201d said John.\nIn one instance, a store with the new APs had 4G costs going through the roof, and the Brookstone Internet provider was unable to provide any further information. \u201cIn the Meraki dashboard, we saw the same spike \u2013 but we could tell what device it was and what application it was,\u201d shared the team. Through the Meraki APs, the team was able to identify and block the bandwidth hogging application across all their locations, settling the issue quickly and in-house. \u201cWe were able to keep allowing things we had to allow, block things we had to block, and it was almost instantaneous across the board. This was very empowering.\u201d\nWith such functionality, the Meraki solution has empowered Brookstone to bring more of their IT back in-house. \u201cWe can now identify a problem and react right away, of our own accord, and make a change that is instantly in effect in all stores; this has been very well received by other parts of the company,\u201d shared the team. \u201cMeraki strikes a nice balance between being able to make powerful changes without being bogged down in all the gory details; you can get into it as far as you want,\u201d said Kyle, whose team members actively manage the Meraki network.\nThe interoperability across the different Meraki products and ability to view them all under a single pane of glass was a big initial driver for the Brookstone team toward Meraki. This unified management as well as the high overall functionality they have experienced with Meraki switching and wireless solutions have inspired the Brookstone team to look to Meraki security appliances and MDM for their next refresh. \u201cFrom a strategic point of view, to have the whole Meraki line so it all works seamlessly is a big thing. We are moving Brookstone to the latest technology to be able to service our customers much better while improving our efficiency.\u201d The team has not yet made use of the built-in Bluetooth capabilities the MR32 provides, but \u201cwe know Bluetooth and Meraki technology will set us up well for changes down the road. We intended to future proof ourselves,\u201d shared the team.\nAs the team looks to expand the benefits of their network to store guests and other teams within the company, they know that the regular feature updates and reliable support Meraki provides have set them up for long-term success. \u201cMy goal as an executive is to bring our services to a higher level and do it better, faster, and for less; the Meraki tools allow us to do that,\u201d said Doug."

    "text": "Sweet Briar College is nestled within more than 3,000 acres of rolling hills and meadows in the foothills of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains. Over 600 on-campus students enjoy the benefits of two lakes, six nature sanctuaries and an extensive network of walking, horseback riding and hiking trails. But before the summer of 2009 students were lacking a cohesive wireless infrastructure.\n\u201cOur wireless infrastructure was aging rapidly, and our WiFi coverage was spotty at best,\u201d said Aaron Mahler, Director of Network Services at Sweet Briar College. Student residence halls were checkered with students\u2019 rogue WiFi devices \u2013 a security concern for the college. In addition, with a sprawling campus and a network conceived from a hodgepodge of WiFi devices, the college\u2019s network was becoming impossible to manage.\nSweet Briar wanted to provide wireless to match every college student\u2019s high expectations. \u201cAs far as our students are concerned, having functional WiFi is akin to having electricity and a dial tone \u2013 it just needs to be there,\u201d Mahler said. At the same time, he knew he needed a network that was secure, centrally managed, and that could support the heavy demand students placed on the system. \u201cOur students are downloading media, media, and more media. We have to have a fast, healthy, ubiquitous WiFi network. It is crucial to student life and the student experience, and that ultimately affects their happiness which in turn affects enrollment and retention.\u201d\nMahler set himself an ambitious goal: with two staff members and 75 days of summer, find and deploy an affordable, reliable, and manageable wireless networking solution.\nAfter speaking to several traditional WiFi vendors, Mahler was introduced to Meraki by Blue Ridge Internetworks. Meraki\u2019s solution was cloud-managed, eliminating the traditional hardware controller.\n\u201cMeraki\u2019s combination of easy management and affordability is what really won us over,\u201d Mahler said. With his original budget, Mahler realized that by deploying Meraki he could nearly double his total number of access points (APs) compared to the next best alternative \u2013 allowing him to provide coverage for the entire campus.\nWith a small IT team, ease of installation was crucial. Over the summer break, Mahler and his associate were able to deploy 130 of Meraki\u2019s plug-and-play, self-configuring APs and upgrade Sweet Briar\u2019s network design to the latest WiFi standard. \u201cWe just plugged them in, turned them on and literally walked away,\u201d Mahler said. \u201cEach AP takes care of itself. No per AP configuration needed.\u201d The campus\u2019s two SSIDs \u2013 one open to everyone through a splash page, and one requiring Sweet Briar login credentials through 802.1X RADIUS \u2013 were equally easy to create and configure with a few mouse-clicks in the Meraki dashboard.\nThe Meraki cloud-based dashboard allows Sweet Briar\u2019s networking team to proactively monitor the network and provides visibility into users, devices, and applications on the network. The intuitive web-based dashboard also simplifies troubleshooting for the help desk staff, who require no special training to monitor the network.\nMeraki\u2019s combination of easy management and affordability is what really won us over.\n\nDirector of Network Services\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful interface and provides us with a tremendous amount of information,\u201d Mahler said. For example, he can see all the iPads on the network simply by searching for the word \u201ciPad,\u201d and he knows that 20% of his bandwidth is going to NetFlix.\nMahler also appreciates the self-healing mesh capability of the Meraki design. If one AP loses connectivity, it will automatically mesh to the nearest connected AP and continue to carry traffic. \u201cWe have had cases when a building was disconnected from our fiber backbone briefly, but the AP in that building connected immediately to APs in a nearby building and continued to seamlessly carry traffic. The students in the dorms were not even aware that it was happening,\u201d he said.\nMahler said he looks forward to expanding Sweet Briar\u2019s network with outdoor APs to encompass the campus\u2019s large green spaces, athletic fields, and weather stations. In the meantime, the Sweet Briar College network sees over 1000 unique clients every week and transfers approximately 9TB every month."

    "text": "Westmont is a top-tier liberal arts college in Santa Barbara.The school has 1,100 students and 300 faculty and staff on its sunny Southern California campus who need constant internet connectivity, indoors and out.\nIn early 2009, Reed Sheard joined Westmont as its new Chief Information Officer. His goal was to turn technology into a competitive advantage for the school, allowing Westmont to continue to attract high-caliber students.\nThe campus\u2019s existing Aruba 802.11b/g network had proven unsatisfactory: coverage was poor, and only a fraction of Sheard\u2019s IT staff had the training necessary to maintain it. Most alarmingly, students and staff were complaining about the network. One of Sheard\u2019s first initiatives was to turn wireless from a liability into an asset by creating an all-802.11n campus.\nSheard created a short list of vendors with the help of Novacoast, a Meraki partner. As they looked at different options, Meraki immediately came to the forefront \u2013 it was fully-featured, easy to deploy and manage, and had the right price. Sheard also evaluated Cisco and Aruba\u2019s latest 802.11n solutions.\nWestmont replaced 272 Aruba access points, which covered only residences and dining areas, with 270 Meraki APs. The same number of Meraki APs blanketed all 100+ acres of the campus. Westmont used Meraki\u2019s MR14 dual-concurrent 802.11n APs for indoor placements, and MR58 3-radio APs outdoors. In addition to the main Santa Barbara campus, Meraki\u2019s web-based centralized management facilitated wireless deployments in Westmont\u2019s two satellite campuses.\nWith a small IT team, Sheard placed a high value on Meraki\u2019s cloud management. \u201cWe have a staff that\u2019s limited in size, and moving the controller outside the physical network and into the cloud allowed my staff to focus on the things that were most important to our college.\u201d Reed\u2019s entire staff now uses the Meraki cloud-based dashboard to troubleshoot and solve students\u2019 connectivity issues over the web, and without specialized training.\nMeraki is one of the best technology decisions I\u2019ve made in over 30 years.\n\nCIO\nWestmont became one of the first colleges to deploy 802.11n campus-wide. Today, more than 1,500 clients access the network each day, transferring over 180GB of data. \u201cOur wireless network is something that we\u2019re proud to talk about now,\u201d Sheard reports. \u201cWe are delivering a level of service to students, faculty, and staff that we\u2019ve never been able to deliver before. Meraki is one of the best technology decisions I\u2019ve made in over 30 years.\u201d\nJust months after installing their Meraki network, Westmont\u2019s cloud-centric IT transformation, including Meraki, Google Apps, Salesforce.com, and Postini, was recognized with the prestigious InfoWorld 100 award.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more happy with how things have turned out,\u201d concludes Sheard.\nMeraki is one of the best technology decisions I\u2019ve made in over 30 years."

    "text": "The classrooms at Florida Coastal School of Law in Jacksonville, Florida feature touch panel screens, full projector audio and visual capabilities, cameras, speakers, microphones\u2014and, of course, wireless Internet.\n\u201cWhen we decided to raise the level of technology on campus, wireless was one area we definitely focused on,\u201d said Mark Sabattini, Director of Information Technology at Coastal Law. \u201cThe school was already fully wired, with dedicated Ethernet jacks on every table, but the interesting thing is that the students don\u2019t use them. They like wireless technology. They want to access the internet anywhere in the building, in the common areas, in the classrooms, on the deck by the lake.\u201d\nCoastal Law has almost 1,800 students regularly seeking access to email or to online legal databases, and many of them are using iPhones, smartphones, or other devices to do it. \u201cWe\u2019ve really seen the impact of the new technology,\u201d Sabattini said.\nFor four years, Coastal Law had another wireless vendor installed with two controllers, but the controllers never worked together properly. After numerous site surveys and engineer visits without a fix for the problem, Coastal Law returned to running a single controller. \u201cWe had no redundancy, and we were at capacity for the traffic we could handle,\u201d Sabattini noted.\nOnce the original wireless vendor stopped supporting its hardware at Coastal Law and a sister school, the need for change was clear. Sabattini wanted a reliable, secure, yet flexible wireless solution that was easy to manage, especially for a school environment. \u201cThe whole point of the system is to give the students easy, fast wireless access,\u201d said Sabattini.\nSabattini thoroughly evaluated solutions from Meraki and other leading wireless manufacturers, determined to find the best fit for Coastal Law. Right away, the heavyweight controller-based solutions from other manufacturers had less appeal.\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to support the controller on-site, and we didn\u2019t want to go back to that,\u201d Sabattini said. \u201cMeraki\u2019s solution, with the virtual cloud-based controller, just made sense. It eliminated the management headache for us.\u201d\nCoastal Law tested 10 Meraki MR14 access points (APs) and found the Enterprise Cloud Controller surprisingly intuitive. \u201cIt was much different from other controllers, where there\u2019s just too much on the screen and it\u2019s overwhelming. This looked more like a website,\u201d Sabattini said. \u201cThere was no complicated network topology to figure out. The graphs were easy to understand, the mapping features and usage statistics were nice, and everything was clear. We like that it\u2019s different, but it can do everything that other controllers do.\u201d\nMeraki\u2019s highly scalable solution offered the built-in redundancy, heavy traffic capacity, and 802.1X authentication that Coastal Law needed\u2014all at an affordable price. \u201cThe deal was too good to pass up,\u201d Sabattini said. \u201cThe other vendors couldn\u2019t touch it by a long way. Meraki really bent over backward to work with us.\u201d\nCoastal Law deployed over the summer. In less than five hours, two teams led by Sabattini and Network Engineer Buddy Searcy powered through all five floors of the Coastal Law building, swapping the original vendor\u2019s APs for 70 Meraki MR14 APs and two MR58 outdoor APs.\nMeraki\u2019s solution, with the virtual cloud-based controller, just made sense. It eliminated the management headache for us.\n\nDirector of Information Technology\n\u201cWe had no downtime,\u201d Sabattini said. Students present during the deployment simply needed to log on to the new Meraki site. \u201cWe configured the APs with a laptop as we went. The Meraki APs showed up in the cloud controller and just started working. It was two or three minutes per access point. As we worked, we saw that people were already logged on to the new APs we\u2019d put up a half hour before.\u201d\nSabattini expects a constant load of between 400 and 800 users, but he said the new Meraki network proved itself during the first two weeks of school. \u201cThat\u2019s always the heaviest load of the year, when every student is on the wireless at once, downloading syllabi and getting familiar with policies and procedures,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year was totally different than other years, because I can\u2019t think of any problems or complaints we had. Our students are very vocal, so that lack of vocalization is a great sign.\u201d\nThe Meraki network lets Sabattini relax, he said. \u2018Now my network engineer and I aren\u2019t worried about the wireless every day, and we see fewer issues at the help desk.\u2019\nMeraki\u2019s solution, with the virtual cloud-based controller, just made sense. It eliminated the management headache for us."

    "text": "The Chicago Architecture Foundation (CAF) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring people to discover why design matters. CAF is located in the famous Santa Fe Building and presents a comprehensive program of tours, exhibitions, lectures, and education activities. Andrew Ruginis, Director of IT, is responsible for providing this world leading organization \u2014 and its staff of 60, volunteer staff of more than 450, and an impressive annual audience of 488,000 \u2014 with a reliable network.\nBefore Meraki, CAF used individually managed (autonomous) access points to provide internet and LAN access for employees Also, CAF provided guests with Internet access during lectures and events. \u201cIT directors of other organizations recommended that I try Meraki,\u201d Ruginis said. \u201cThey are Meraki customers and had great experiences to share.\u201d\nRuginis evaluated two Meraki MR16 access points (AP). The installation was painless and straightforward. \u201cIt was very quick. I unboxed the AP, a minute to download the firmware upgrade, and it was up and running,\u201d he said. Ruginis experimented with the features by adjusting the configurations on the Meraki dashboard and measuring the impact using Meraki\u2019s WiFi Stumbler, a free WiFi planning tool. Given how critical network availability was to CAF, Ruginis also tested the quality of Meraki\u2019s technical support teams. \u201cMeraki was very accessible and responsive to my questions,\u201d he explained. \u201cWith such great technology and overall experience, I quickly ordered the APs for the entire organization.\u201d\nThe Meraki MX made a complex project very simple. The entire installation was a smooth and enjoyable experience. There was no need for training or certification like other vendors.\n\nDirector of IT\nCompared to the individually-managed APs and to traditional solutions with WiFi controllers, Meraki\u2019s cloud-managed APs saved CAF and Ruginis money and time. Moreover, Meraki\u2019s robust and pragmatic design helped CAF avoid downtime, Ruginis explained, \u201cWhen an AP loses uplink connectivity, it will automatically fall into repeater mode and my users are uninterrupted. This feature has been a lifesaver!\u201d Lastly, Meraki\u2019s platform provides great visibility and control. \u201cI can see who is on my wireless network and I have all the tools to control the wireless usage, like traffic shaping or denying access for unauthorized devices.\u201d\nIn addition to upgrading the APs, CAF added a second internet link to increase bandwidth and uptime. Ruginis looked to the Meraki MX security appliance to combine the WAN links into a single uplink, balancing the load between the connections and maximizing WAN uptime. \u201cThe Meraki MX made a complex project very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire installation was a smooth and enjoyable experience. There was no need for training or certification like with other vendors.\u201d As CAF grows, Ruginis is excited to deploy client VPN for CAF\u2019s telecommuters. \u201cVPN for telecommuters was not at the top of my mind when I installed the MX,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe versatility of the MX\u2019s feature set makes my investment future proof.\u201d\nThe growth of CAF and growth in the number of devices brought about another challenge for Ruginis\u2019 selfdescribed \u201cone-man IT shop\u201d: mobile device management (MDM).\u201cI wanted a simple yet professional way to manage and keep inventory of CAF\u2019s mobile devices,\u201d he said. \u201cI was looking for a web-based product that required no onsite server or aggregator.\u201d Again, IT directors of other organizations recommended that Ruginis take a look at a Meraki product: Systems Manager, Meraki\u2019s cloud based mobile device management platform.\nRuginis deployed Systems Manager to each device by running the installer file directly or remotely off a local file server. Ruginis uses Systems Manager on a daily basis to remote desktop into various servers and devices, troubleshoot devices remotely, monitor devices\u2019 CPU and RAM utilization. \u201cWith Systems Manager, I can remote desktop into my user\u2019s PC or Mac. Moreover, Meraki is the only MDM platform that can provide unified visibility and management from the top of the network with the MX security appliance down to users\u2019 devices with Systems Manager,\u201d Ruginis said. \u201cIf an organization is managing devices but has no such product like Systems Manager then I would say they are not really managing devices at all. Organizations need to get on-board and go with Systems Manager for the ease of deployment and intuitive management. Especially because it\u2019s free, there\u2019s no reason not to use it.\u201d\nThe increasing number of devices has outgrown CAF\u2019s switching infrastructure which was a mix of switches from various vendors and Ruginis was excited for the visibility and control the Meraki MS access switch can provide to his network. Ruginis evaluated the MS42 switch and was very impressed with the MS\u2019 zero-touch deployment. \u201cThe installation could not have been simpler,\u201d he said. \u201cI took the switch out of the box and it downloaded the latest firmware. The most time consuming part was the cables \u2014 it took more time to unplug and reconnect patch cables than to actually set up the Meraki switch.\u201d Planning for the growth of CAF, Ruginis is keen to deploy additional MS features, like voice vLAN and QoS, to accommodate for the organization\u2019s VoIP needs.\nRuginis\u2019 Meraki network simplifies his task in managing day-to-day network administration and meeting the needs of a growing organization. He concluded, \u201cIt is easy to run and manage my Meraki network, I didn\u2019t have to go to class or get certifications to provide a world-class network for my users.\u201d"

    "text": "Steve Shead had a problem. As the IT leader at CafePress, he needed a robust wireless solution to keep his company\u2019s rapidly growing engineering, marketing, administrative and production staff reliably connected. CafePress is the world\u2019s biggest destination for self-expression through merchandise and the leader in user generated commerce.\nLaunched in 1999, CafePress has empowered users to create, buy and sell customized merchandise online using the company\u2019s print-on-demand and e-commerce services. Today, CafePress is a growing community of over 6.5 million members who celebrate merchandise that reflects their interests, passions, beliefs and affiliations.\nThe wireless solution Shead inherited had a bad habit of dropping connections when staff moved between floors in the corporate offices. He was spending a lot of time fielding complaints, sniffing out failed access points and getting the APs back online. It was costing him in more ways than one. \u201cPeoples\u2019 connections just kept dropping off,\u201d said Shead.\nHe needed coverage for over 100 employees in an office building with a unique layout, as well as a 150,000 square-foot production facility. But his options seemed limited at best. Making things more difficult, CafePress is a multiple-OS office, and was Steve was challenged with integrating his non-Windows users onto any network powerful enough to meet demands.\nIt was time for a change. Shead began researching options. After a test-drive of another vendor\u2019s solution, he was more frustrated than ever. \u201cI thought anything would be better than what we have. But what we ended up with was too complex for us; it\u2019s me and a few other people managing IT, so we can\u2019t waste time. It took us 4 weeks to realize they sold us something we just couldn\u2019t use.\u201d\nSo Shead developed an ROI business case for several available solutions. \u201cI thought to myself, how many APs do I need for maximum coverage, but with minimum spending?\u201d he said. When he presented the various case scenarios, the company chose Meraki.\n\u201cThe thinking was that, if this is as easy as they say it is, let\u2019s just do it.\u201d So Shead ordered some Meraki access points and took them for a spin. \u201cIt was plug, play, configure, and you\u2019re done. Wasn\u2019t that an eye-opener?\u201d Shead said. \u201cThe team came in, plugged them in, configured them, and they were gone. They weren\u2019t even here for an hour.\u201d\nWhat appealed most to CafePress was the simplicity of the deployment, and also the ease with which Shead could manage the network from anywhere using the Meraki Dashboard. \u201cWhat struck me all the way through the deployment was how you just plug in a Meraki AP, then it joins the network, all on its own. It doesn\u2019t get any simpler than that,\u201d he said.\nSecurity was also a concern for Shead, who like many IT leaders needs to protect sensitive and proprietary information, but also needs to provide flexible access to people in many different environments. Initially, Steve was concerned about tunneling through his firewall to access Meraki\u2019s cloud \u2014but his concern didn\u2019t last long. \u201cThe security SSL is the same as what we were already using for external APIs, for example. I\u2019ve already tunneled out for them, its part of our security policy to do so. So what\u2019s not to trust? At first I was concerned that the security was off-site. I talked myself into that corner and right back out again.\u201d\nShead is employing multiple SSIDs to create one network for the corporate employees and a public one for guests, partners and vendors. He is considering using additional SSID\u2019s for VoIP or security cameras in the future. Knowing Meraki is VoIP capable helped him make his decision.\nMeraki performs much better that our previous solution from a major known vendor, plus I\u2019ve got the cost savings on both ends. Meraki is infinitely cheaper, quicker, and more robust.\n\nDirector of IT & Information Security Officer\nThe network Shead built is working even better than he expected. \u201cYou can roam from my office, into the elevator, and around upstairs and never lose your signal,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s great, because we have a lot of engineers, and they like to roam.\u201d If Shead ever sees a blip in coverage he just plugs in another Meraki access point to boost the signal.\nWhen considering a wireless solution, Shead used his personal methodology. \u201cThere are really two points of cost,\u201d he says. \u201cOne is the physical dollar cost. But there is also total cost of ownership, including system administration and reliability. Meraki performs much better that our previous solution from a major known vendor, plus I\u2019ve got the cost savings on both ends. Meraki is infinitely cheaper, quicker, and more robust.\u201d\nFinally, there is also the refreshing fact that Meraki acts as a partner to Shead, helping him maximize his network\u2019s capabilities. \u201cI\u2019ve been impressed with the technology, but also with our interaction with the company and the engineers all along the way.\u201d\nMeraki performs much better that our previous solution from a major known vendor, plus I\u2019ve got the cost savings on both ends. Meraki is infinitely cheaper, quicker, and more robust."

    "text": "ClueCon is an annual three-day conference for open source telephony developers and users. Sponsored by prominent VoIP players such as Barracuda Networks\u2019 CudaTel and the open source telephony platform FreeSWITCH, this year\u2019s ClueCon MMX conference at the Trump Hotel in Chicago was attended by hundreds of open source development engineers, CIO\u2019s, and entrepreneurs.\n\u201cWhen the conference is in full swing, there are 25 rows of people stretching across a full ballroom,\u201d observed Tony Minessale, ClueCon\u2019s creator and the founder of FreeSWITCH. \u201cEvery one of those people has a laptop, and each of them has another two or three devices hiding in a pocket, connecting and disconnecting at will.\u201d It\u2019s a wireless networking challenge, to say the least.\nThis year Brian West, ClueCon\u2019s event coordinator, made reliable wireless access a high priority for the show\u2014especially because the conference WiFi had failed the previous three years, taking down the venues\u2019 wired networks at the same time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve broken hotel routers, we\u2019ve overloaded servers, we\u2019ve had a hotel\u2019s DHCP server run out of leases, it\u2019s been a little bit of everything,\u201d West said. \u201cWe\u2019d waste two or three hours and figure out ten different ways to fix something, and then something else would break in a new way.\u201d\nFor example, when the venue\u2019s network went down at the first ClueCon event, they brought in a satellite link and ran an Ethernet cable from the roof to a switch in the event room. The cables they had in reserve weren\u2019t long enough, so for two days a \u2018floating\u2019 switch held up by two Ethernet cables hung like a clothesline behind the presenter.\nWest received a recommendation for Meraki\u2019s wireless solution from Dean Drako, CEO of Barracuda Networks, and West decided to go for it. \u201cMeraki looked much better than any of our other choices,\u201d he said.\nMeraki expected intense usage from ClueCon\u2019s 200+ highly technical attendees. With that in mind, Meraki planned the wireless deployment at headquarters a week before the event, uploading a floor plan of the 4,480 square foot Trump Ballroom to the online dashboard and configuring the four MR14 dual-radio access points (APs) that would be used. To protect the hotel\u2019s wired network, the APs were rate limited to 500 kbps/250 kbps per user for an expected 15 Mbps pipe, with a maximum ratio of 50 users-to-AP.\nDespite this careful preparation, Meraki faced several key challenges when it came time to actually deploy. Meraki Sales Engineer Dan Pittelkow arrived at the Trump Hotel the day before the conference and learned that the conference would have an 8 Mbps backhaul rather than the expected 15 Mbps. This backhaul would also share the same T3 line as the rest of the hotel, an oversight that raised immediate red flags in terms of the event\u2019s bandwidth impact on the Trump\u2019s LAN.\nIn addition, when Pittelkow attempted to secure the uplink for the conference network, the hotel\u2019s splash page prevented the Meraki APs from connecting to the cloud. Meanwhile, the Meraki event network was competing with the hotel\u2019s free WiFi network in the ballroom. This problem meant attendees could get around the Meraki-imposed 500 kbps/200 kbps rate limits by switching to the Trump network\u2014resulting in a temporary individual increase to a 9.5 Mbps rate limit, but cumulatively causing disaster. With the entire hotel running off a 44 Mbps T3 line, the bandwidth would quickly be used up, making all hotel guests and attendees suffer. \u201cTwo people could have joined the network and taken the entire hotel down,\u201d West said.\nWest and Pittelkow met with the Trump\u2019s IT staff and convinced them to power off all the Trump APs in the ballroom area. Trump also allocated static IP addresses for the Meraki APs, bypassing the hotel splash page. To avoid any further dependency on the hotel\u2019s DHCP server, the Meraki network was configured in NAT mode, meaning each Meraki AP would assign IP addresses to clients out of a private pool.\nTo maximize coverage, the ClueCon/Meraki setup team propped the four MR14 APs on stands in the corners of the ballroom. They were powered through a simple Netgear 12-port PoE switch under the stage. Pittelkow tested the AP and user rate-limits and enabled channel spreading, with 20 MHz wide channels on the 2.4 GHz band and 40 MHz wide channels on the 5 GHz band. After the APs were brought online, he scanned for rogue APs and let the cloud  automatically reassign the channels. Pittelkow used the Meraki WiFi Stumbler, a freely available web-based site survey tool, to confirm that the APs were each on different 5 GHz channels, and only one 2.4 GHz channel overlapped.\nAltogether the physical setup took only one hour, and the ballroom was ready the next morning when the VoIP enthusiasts arrived and connected to the unencrypted Meraki SSID via a conference-related splash page.\nPittelkow used the Meraki Dashboard with live updates to proactively monitor the network and the per-client usage throughout the event. Under the initial rate-limit, the event\u2019s overall load on the hotel\u2019s pipe remained at approximately 6 Mbps. Meanwhile, a number of attendees joked that they had taken down conference networks in the past, and they could surely take down Meraki\u2019s\u2014but they were happily mistaken.\nThis is the first event I have been to where everyone is online with a laptop and the wireless is working just fine. Huge kudos to you.\nCluecon conference attendee\n\u00a0\nOver the course of the conference, the wireless network saw 246 unique client devices and transferred 34.6 GB down and 8.76 GB up with no downtime. Minessale said he received a lot of positive feedback from delighted attendees who were surprised at the steady connection. \u201cPeople anticipate being let down,\u201d he said. \u201cHotels are never prepared for the traffic at these events, so Meraki provides a great solution for a common but important problem.\u201d\nConference attendee Darren Schreiber sent Meraki an unsolicited email echoing Minessale. \u201cI go to about five conferences a year with 100-1000 people at each. The wireless ALWAYS stinks, without ANY exception,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is the first event I have been to where everyone is online with a laptop and the wireless is working just fine. Huge kudos to you\u2014it helps me stay in touch with work while I\u2019m gone for a week, which is essential to my ability to come to these things.\u201d\nWest said that Meraki\u2019s robust, reliable wireless solution also relieved a lot of his conference planning stress. \u201cI\u2019m definitely planning to use Meraki for next year\u2019s ClueCon.\u201d\nThis is the first event I have been to where everyone is online with a laptop and the wireless is working just fine. Huge kudos to you."

    "text": "Diann Banaszek, Marketing Partner for Apple American Group LLC, thought it would be a great idea to offer guest WiFi at Applebee\u2019s Grill & Bar \u2014 and to use click-through splash pages to share targeted messages with customers.\nWith approximately 270 Applebee\u2019s Neighborhood Grill and Bar restaurants nationwide, Apple American Group LLC is the largest Applebee\u2019s franchisee and the second largest franchisee of any type in the world. And with a youthful target audience, Banaszek felt that guest WiFi was a must.\n\u201cFor one thing, customers expect you to have it,\u201d Banaszek said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be current. But we\u2019re also looking for new friends on Facebook, seeking ways to get customer email addresses, and of course we have messages we want to get out, such as our Girls\u2019 Nights Out or our late night half-price appetizers.\u201d\nA number of Apple American Group Applebee\u2019s restaurants already offered guest wireless through consumer-grade access points. But when problems arose, Network Administrators Leslie McMasters or Rick Holley would get a call.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even know the restaurant\u2019s WiFi providers, but we were expected to fix the WiFi,\u201d McMasters said. \u201cIt became clear that we needed the same network from one location to the next, so that we would know how to deal with it. Plus, there was the reporting piece. Is anyone using the wireless? How much bandwidth is being used? We didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nBanaszek was also concerned about what people were actually doing on the various networks. \u201cSince we had no landing page, we had no opportunity to ask people to agree to terms,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, not only can we monitor the amount and type of use, we can also ensure that the system is being used appropriately.\u201d\nApplebee\u2019s started testing Meraki access points (APs) in California and quickly expanded to other markets. Because the Meraki APs are plug-and-play and the network is managed through the cloud, McMasters and Holley can monitor the network from anywhere.\n\u201cThe restaurant managers could install the APs without on-site IT,\u201d McMasters said. \u201cThe Meraki dashboard makes it easy to manage the WiFi across all the restaurants, and we have the visibility we wanted.\u201d\n\u201cConnectivity has been stable,\u201d Holley added. \u201cAnd now we know how many users are connecting and with what kinds of devices.\u201d\nThe entire network is PCI compliant. Guest traffic from the Meraki access points goes directly to the Internet, and Meraki\u2019s built-in stateful firewall prevents this traffic from accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE).\nAll network bandwidth is shared, so Holley uses Meraki\u2019s integrated application-aware traffic shaping to limit bandwidth for traffic such as peer-to-peer, online backup, and web file sharing. Holley also uses Meraki\u2019s SSID availability to restrict guest access to particular hours.\n\u201cEverything was easy to set up,\u201d Holley said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty intuitive.\u201d\nApplebee\u2019s is also working on a variety of customized click-through splash pages for different marketing campaigns. Relevant splash pages with time-sensitive discounts will be linked to different SSIDs, which will broadcast at lunch, dinner, or late-night.\nCustomers expect you to have WiFi. And being up to date is part of our brand\n\nMarketing Partner, Apple American Group LLC\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving the customer the benefit of more information,\u201d Banaszek said. \u201cThe Meraki dashboard lets us see that we have more smart phones and handheld devices on the network, along with some iPads.

    "text": "Alvin Independent School District (ISD) covers 250 square miles in Brazoria County, Texas. Its two high schools, two alternative schools, five junior high schools, and fourteen elementary schools serve approximately 19,000 students and utilize over 2,500 staff members.\nThe district initially launched a 1:1 project for junior high students, meaning that every sixth, seventh, and eighth grade student had a handheld computing device in the classroom. Replacing the paper and pencil model, students at Alvin ISD read, write, solve problems, and get feedback from teachers through these devices. In the 2011 school year the district upgraded its technology, offering every junior high student an HP Netbook.\nThat works out to 4,400 HP Netbooks across the district. \u201cWe knew our wireless system wasn\u2019t going to support the demand this initiative would generate,\u201d said John Wilds, Alvin ISD\u2019s network manager. \u201cLast year was pretty successful with the 1:1 project, but it was definitely taxing for the wireless.\u201d\nAlvin ISD was running HP Procurve with approximately 530 HP access points (APs), one per classroom. Because most of the APs were single-radio 802.11b/g HP420s, the HP Netbooks were limited to 802.11g speed, and high client density across campus caused problems with connectivity.\nThe APs also had to be managed individually\u2014a time consuming project, said Jacob Stewart, Alvin ISD\u2019s wireless network technician. Before the 1:1 rollout, the network team spent three months manually reconfiguring all of the APs to ensure identical configurations.\nTo support the wireless access for the Netbooks across five campuses, Wilds and Stewart wanted centralized management, high speed, no interference between closely placed APs, and a minimum capacity of 30 simultaneous clients per AP. And, as a school district, cost was a \u201chuge consideration,\u201d Wilds said.\nWilds and Stewart considered simply upgrading the existing HP system, but testing revealed band steering problems\u2014automatically \u2018steering\u2019 5GHz-capable devices to the 5 GHz spectrum\u2014that they were unable to solve. They also evaluated solutions from Motorola, Aruba, and the Cisco Meraki product line. Motorola\u2019s complexity and Aruba\u2019s expense made the Cisco Meraki plug-and-play solution immediately appealing. However, Wilds initially had concerns about the offsite controller.\n\u201cBut once I understood that the AP continues to function even if it can\u2019t communicate with the cloud, that alleviated my concern,\u201d he said. Now he says he appreciates the low-maintenance centralized management that the Meraki browser-based dashboard affords.\nThe Cisco Meraki APs\u2019 mesh functionality also surprised Wilds\u2014in a good way. \u201cWe could tell the Meraki line was a whole different kind of product from the initial setup, when the Meraki product representative stacked ten APs on top of each other and started doing the configuration. I said, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 because I expected serious channel conflicts, but he told me they\u2019re designed to work like that.\u201d\nTo test the throughput of each solution, Wilds and Stewart prepared two rooms with one AP and 90 HP Netbooks in each and then imaged all the Netbooks. \u201cOn pure density hitting back to two APs, the Meraki APs were the best performers,\u201d Wilds said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know it\u2019s possible to run 180 Netbooks off two APs with no problem.\u201d\nAlvin ISD purchased the cloud management license and 771 Cisco Meraki MR14 APs\u2014enough to replace all the existing APs, improve weak coverage areas, and offer coverage to campuses that never had it before, including two campuses still under construction.\n\u201cOriginally we planned to only provide wireless to our 1:1 schools,\u201d Wilds said. \u201cBut with the affordable pricing of Meraki products, we were able to do the entire district.\u201d\nDeployment took less than three weeks. Once Stewart realized how easy the AP installation was, he hired student helpers with no formal training to do it for him, giving him time to work on other projects. \u201cI showed them what I wanted, explained what wasn\u2019t right in the old system that they could fix with this new system, and sent them out to do it,\u201d Stewart said.\u201cIt was that easy.\u201d\nI really think Meraki is the optimal solution for an environment with a high density of clients.\n\nNetwork Manager\nWilds said that the Cisco Meraki products\u2019 unique self-healing architecture has given him new insights into his network. For example, the day after bringing one campus online, he noticed in the Cisco Meraki dashboard that some of the APs were working as mesh repeaters rather than running in gateway mode. When he investigated the problem, he found approximately 50 cables that needed to be reterminated.\n\u201cThe Meraki APs were diagnosing our bad cables for us,\u201d Wilds laughed. \u201cHow long were our old APs running on bad cables and we never knew it?\u201d\nUsing the easily accessible, data-rich reporting available in the dashboard, Wilds is able to identify trends in how the network is being used, as well as how devices are being used. He can then make changes to how technology is incorporated into classes to maximize its full potential. \u201cOne example of this,\u201d Wilds explained, \u201ccame from looking at the reports and discovering that Netbooks were utilized more when they stayed in a classroom, instead of with a student. So we altered our 1:1 plans, created Netbook sets assigned to classrooms, and consequently saw a dramatic increase in usage.\u201d\nFollowing the recent release of new Cisco Meraki access points, Alvin ISD has deployed over 200 MR18s and 60 MR26s in the high schools and junior highs. Unprecedented performance designed for high capacity environments and a third radio dedicated to providing 24\u00d77 wireless security built into the new APs provided a clear solution to the growing technology demands on the Alvin ISD network. \u201cHaving the latest 802.11n technology with the MR18s and MR26s allows us to serve our increasing client load in a very challenging high-density environment,\u201d Wilds said.\nAs technology and education needs evolved, so did the use of devices in the classroom. With the idea of purchasing devices to match particular education purposes, Wilds has created a diverse, device-neutral environment. Kindles are being used for reading programs, Chromebooks for content formation and consumption, Android and iOS devices for mobility and media creation.\nThe introduction of BYOD into the curriculum is yet another byproduct of being able to blanket the district with easy\u2013to-manage wireless. At first, BYOD was limited to high schools, but Wilds quickly opened it down to 6th grade classrooms. \u201cWith the dashboard, I can ensure network security and limit access to appropriate content with custom rules,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a firewall, but at the AP level.\u201d The initiative provides increased device diversity in the classrooms and supplemental technology when needed for educational programs.\nWith airtime fairness and auto RF optimization, Wilds doesn\u2019t worry about high density areas. In fact, he encourages students to use the network more. \u201cThe high schools were interested in which areas were strongly using BYOD and how. It became a competition to see which school could utilize the network most,\u201d Wilds laughed. \u201cIf network usage somehow hits the roof, that\u2019s great, it means it\u2019s being used! That\u2019s what it\u2019s there for and we can always add more Meraki APs if needed.\u201d\nWilds and Stewart say that the beginning of the school year is normally the most stressful time in managing the wireless network\u2014but not anymore. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent no time at all on wireless issues, and we\u2019ve had no complaints about laptops not connecting,\u201d Wilds said. \u201cThe way the APs mesh together and coordinate to get the best signal instead of competing with each other is a huge benefit. I really think Cisco Meraki products are the optimal solution for an environment with a high density number of clients.\u201d\nI really think Meraki is the optimal solution for an environment with a high density of clients."

    "text": "Davidoff Malito & Hutcher LLP is a multidiscipline full-service law firm, providing expertise in government relations as well as traditional legal services. Founded in 1975, Davidoff is head- quartered in Manhattan and has strategic offices in Long Island, Albany, and Washington, D.C. Using the IT consulting services of Kraft Kennedy, Davidoff has deployed a Meraki wireless network to provide guest Internet access as well as secure employee access for roughly 100 full-time employees at the firm.\nFor 5 years, Davidoff had wanted a wireless network at its offices, but two factors prevented the firm from deploying one: security and cost. From a security perspective, the guest wireless network needed to be completely separate from the employee wireless network. The guest network would provide Internet only access, with no access to internal resources on the local area network (LAN). Furthermore, any viruses or worms on guests\u2019 computers must not be able to reach the secure internal network. In contrast, the employee network would provide connectivity both to the Internet and to resources on the local area network (LAN). In order to separate these two wireless networks, Davidoff faced a costly proposition. Davidoff considered paying for a separate Internet connection that would be dedicated to the guest network, in addition to the existing Internet connection for employees. Moreover, many of the wireless access points on the market could only broadcast a single wireless network, so Davidoff would have to double the number of access points for the same coverage area, simply to offer the guest network and the employee network simultaneously. This design was too complex and costly for Davidoff to accept. But, throughout this time, the need for guest access was only increasing. Davidoff bought time by setting up wired desktop computers in conference rooms for guests, but these desktops still exposed the internal network to security intrusions. Meanwhile, new associates joining the firm from laptop-centric law schools increasingly expected a secure internal wireless network to facilitate tasks a simple as note-taking from a laptop during meetings.\nFinally, Rob Cohen from Kraft Kennedy, the IT consulting company for law firms and legal departments, contacted Davidoff. Meg DeGia, Davidoff\u2019s office administrator, recalls the conversation: \u201cRob called and said, \u2018We have the solution to answer all of your concerns.\u2019 That solution was Meraki.\u201d Meraki\u2019s dual-radio access points were deployed in the Manhattan and Long Island offices, and both offices share the same configuration. 2 wireless networks are broadcasted by the access points\u2014a guest network that provides Internet-only access, and an employee network that authenticates users with a WPA2 pre-shared key and provides access to LAN resources. The Davidoff wireless network is managed through Meraki\u2019s web-based management interface by Davidoff\u2019s single on-site IT administrator, Shane Martin. \u201cI thought it was going to be a lot harder to install Meraki,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI just plugged in the access points, went onto the web site, and configured the network. It took only a couple of hours.\u201d Since the Meraki solution is centrally managed, bringing up the In the Long Island office was as simple as plugging in the access point, and letting it load its configuration from the Meraki Cloud Controller. Since there was no on-site IT staff in the Long Island office, installation was done by an attorney. \u201cAnd if an attorney can install it\u2026\u201d Martin trails off with a smile and a wink.\nI thought it was going to be a lot harder to install Meraki, I just plugged in the access points, went onto the web site, and configured the network. It took only a couple of hours.\n\nIT Administrator\nToday, over 30 guest users are on the Davidoff guest network at peak each day, and employees are able to securely and reliably connect to the private network. Despite the thick walls in the building, which was constructed in the 1960\u2019s, the Meraki APs have been able to cover the entire floor. One of the biggest unexpected benefits of the wireless network is for the receptionist at Davidoff\u2019s Manhattan office, who did not have any network connectivity prior to the Meraki wireless network. Now, the receptionist can be more productive by being online, performing tasks such as being able to add names for security to allow into the building. \u201cIn this economy, we all have multiple roles,\u201d says DeGia. \u201cWireless has been very valuable because now, we can all accomplish a lot more.\u201d\nI thought it was going to be a lot harder to install Meraki, I just plugged in the access points, went onto the web site, and configured the network. It took only a couple of hours."

    "text": "With the Notre Dame Cathedral standing mere meters away, the seven story Hotel Agora Saint Germain lies in the heart of Paris\u2019 rich culture and history. The Hotel Agora, managed by Cedric Sahuc, provides a luxurious haven for travelers amidst France\u2019s iconic landmarks, including the Louvre, the River Seine, the Pantheon, and the Opera Bastille.\nPreviously, the Hotel Agora\u2019s wireless Internet was provided by an outside vendor, meaning that Sahuc lacked control over the network he offered to guests and used for administrative purposes. The landing page for the hotel\u2019s guests had no branding related to the hotel. Guests and hotel staff suffered from numerous performance issues, and the staff had no visibility into the clients accessing the network or the type of traffic on it.\nOne of Sahuc\u2019s major concerns was strict conformity with French HADOPI law, which mandates compliance with copyright laws. \u201cIf a customer downloads illegal content on our network, our network can be disabled,\u201d he said. Sahuc wanted to find an affordable networking solution that would not only address this issue, but also would provide him with control over the hotel\u2019s computers and systems, would be user friendly and secure for guests, and would promote the hotel via splash pages.\nSahuc sought the advice of Gonzague Dambricourt with Bouche Cousue, an Internet solutions partner, who recommended Meraki\u2019s branch gateway and 802.11n wireless LAN. \u201cMeraki provides a networking solution that is reliable,\u201d Dambricourt said. \u201cThe cloud management means there is no need for on site IT.\u201d Meraki\u2019s integrated client fingerprinting, content filtering, and traffic shaping would provide the visibility and control over clients and applications that Sahuc needed to ensure compliance with HADOPI law.\nIn a business where guests and administrators use the wireless on a daily basis, the ongoing operation of the network is mission critical to the hotel. Dambricourt was impressed by the MX70\u2019s smart load balancing functionality, which balances traffic between two DSL connections. \u201cEven if one connection stops working, the network relies on the other connection,\u201d he said.\nIn just one afternoon, Bouche Cousue deployed a complete Meraki network \u2013 from the branch gateway to wireless access points throughout the hotel. Dambricourt created multiple SSIDs: one for secure hotel administration and another for guests. The latter uses Meraki\u2019s LAN isolation feature, which prevents guests from accessing the internal network as well as each other, eliminating privacy and virus concerns. Using Meraki\u2019s custom splash page feature, Dambricourt created a hotel landing page emblazoned with the hotel\u2019s logo and additional offerings such as the phone number for reception, breakfast hours, and the hotel\u2019s Facebook page.\nDambricourt also installed Meraki\u2019s Systems Manager on staff computers and servers, providing monitoring, diagnostics, and remote desktop capabilities. \u201cThe server is mission critical,\u201d Dambricourt said.\nNo one provides this kind of traffic shaping and content filtering at such an affordable price.\n\nManager\n\u201cIt\u2019s very helpful that we can see on the dashboard if it\u2019s down or if the memory is too low.\u201d\nAfter witnessing the ease and success of the Meraki network deployment, Sahuc\u2019s wife deployed Meraki in her hotel, the Hotel Abbatial. Through the web-based Meraki dashboard, the Sahucs can monitor the wireless and wired networks of both hotels, and will soon connect them with the MX70\u2019s auto-configuring site-to-site VPN.\nSince the Meraki platform monitors the network from the cloud, Sahuc is notified within minutes of any network problem. With Meraki\u2019s remote tools, he can often fix issues without going on site. Guests no longer complain about Internet problems and are even able to stream video. \u201cWe can customize the system to our needs,\u201d Sahuc said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see everything in one interface.\u201d\nBest of all, Meraki\u2019s layer 7 application traffic shaping enables Sahuc to streamline traffic over the network as well as prevent access to prohibited peer to peer sites that could violate the HADOPI law. \u201cWe could not do that before,\u201d Sahuc said. \u201cNo one provides this kind of traffic shaping and content filtering at such an affordable price.\u201d"

Today the college supports more than 11,000 students and offers 500+ courses from entry-level programmes to degree-level qualifications. As well as achieving exemplary results (99% pass rate for A-Levels), BSDC prides itself on its modern facilities.\n\u201cA lot of the staff members have iPads or smart phones and, of course, the students have a plethora of mobile devices so it was really a natural progression to upgrade our WiFi capabilities\u201d comments Vaughan Dyche, Head of IT at BSDC.\nBSDC worked with their technology partner, Jade Communications, to evaluate various vendors and shortlist them to Aerohive, Meru and Meraki. Each supplier was invited to the college to present their proposed solution. Judging was based on a range of functionality criteria such as guest and private network management, access control and cost. \u201cMeraki stood out for us among the supplier presentations \u2013 the functionality of the dashboard was fantastic and incredibly intuitive\u201d explains Ian Robinson, Network & IT Manager at BSDC.\n\u201cWe were really impressed with Meraki and confident that it was the right solution for us\u201d said Dyche. BSDC went on to deploy around 100 Meraki cloud managed wireless APs across its main Lichfield Street campus as well as The WorkShop and Shobnall Sports Centre sites.\nThe network now requires zero dedicated staff, with 3 team members managing the network when needed. \u201cUsing the Meraki Dashboard is so straightforward and intuitive. We didn\u2019t need any training to create and manage SSIDs\u201d said Robinson. BSDC has 3 SSIDs configured at the main Lichfield Street campus: corporate, BSDC and guest. Staff and students authenticate to the BSDC SSID using log in credentials and guests are required to register their details to be authorized for access. \u201cThe BSDC and guest login pages were created using the custom themed splash pages built into the Meraki dashboard and we even have our college logo uploaded\u201d explained Robinson. Guest access is granted to local contractors while they\u2019re completing work on-site.\nTo ensure our network isn\u2019t congested with guest traffic outside of business hours, we use the SSID availability feature on the Meraki dashboard to only broadcast the guest SSID between 7am-5pm, Mon-Fri\n\nNetwork & IT Manager\nThe initial tender for BSDC was for wireless coverage across the main campus. However, BSDC expanded the deployment to include Meraki MX security appliances, after seeing the power of their multi-site networking features. \u201cWe realised how simple it was to setup and manage site-to-site VPN through the Meraki dashboard so we decided to expand the network to include three of the college\u2019s sites\u201d said Robinson.\nBSDC has had the Meraki APs and security devices successfully deployed for over a year now. \u201cThe WiFi is extremely reliable, students are able to study on comfy sofas instead of desks and we\u2019ve really had nothing but positive comments from staff and students\u201d said Dyche.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sound very clich\u00e9 but Meraki is the gift that keeps giving! The automatic firmware upgrades are fantastic; they feel as though they\u2019ve been custom-built for us, and they\u2019re included in the license-fee!\u201d said Robinson."

    "text": "Founded in 2000 and located in Saint-Denis, just north of Paris, Linkbynet is an IT Facilities Management and Hosting company. In the past ten years, the company has established itself as the primary provider of facilities management, cloud computing and web hosting services to nearly 25% of CAC 40 companies. Linkbynet has over 410 employees globally, distributed across five locations, including Mauritius, Canada and France.\nOlivier Morel, IT Security Engineer at Linkbynet, manages the IT security at their headquarters in Paris. Morel is responsible for defining and deploying the security architecture, strengthening compliance indicators and improving technology intelligence.\nThe network architecture that Linkbynet originally put in place at their headquarters was very fragmented. \u201cWe had a lack of coverage. The wireless access points were difficult to manage. We didn\u2019t have any WiFi controllers because they were too expensive. This not only prevented us from having any reporting visibility in terms of network usage, but also hindered user support,\u201d said Morel. The Paris facility was also not compatible with the latest Wi-Fi technologies in terms of coverage, security and visitor management. \u201cAs Linkbynet is a fast growing company, we had to quickly find a scalable solution based on our own pace, while controlling costs.\u201d\nWithin three days we received an access point and within minutes we deployed our desired configuration, without any use of documentation or help from technical support.\n\nIT Security Engineer\nAt the start of the project, Linkbynet had two objectives. The first was to find a solution that would not require excessive training, administration and monitoring. The second was a solution that would be affordable.\nMorel discovered Meraki when reading Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Wireless LAN Infrastructure. \u201cIt was important for us to examine an innovative player in addition to the usual players in this segment,\u201d he said. To complete his research, Morel also investigated networking solutions from Avaya and Aerohive.\n\u201cWe chose Meraki because it was so fast and easy to manage in the evaluation process,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin three days we received an access point and within minutes we deployed our desired configuration, without any use of documentation or help from technical support. It is very simple to configure Meraki hardware with advanced features.\u201d\nLinkbynet were impressed with the reporting capabilities on offer from Meraki\u2019s web-based dashboard. Using the Layer 7 visibility on the dashboard, Morel was able to understand how different users utilised the network. \u201cWe liked the product design as well as the information-rich network summary reports available from the dashboard,\u201d Morel said. \u201cAdditionally the approach of network management from the cloud resulted in significant savings compared to traditional vendors, where purchasing a physical controller accounted for almost half of the quote.\u201d\nLinkbynet deployed 15 Meraki cloud-managed wireless APs, including one outdoor AP, and 6 Meraki cloud-managed switches at their head office. Most recently, an AP was also sent to the company\u2019s subsidiaries in Montreal and Nantes.\n\u201cWe just sent an access point to our Montreal branch,\u201d Morel explained. \u201cA network administrator connected it within seconds and replicated the setup we had at our headquarters. This allowed us to have the same configuration and the same level of security there as we have here. After the ease of deployment outside our headquarters, we plan to deploy Meraki at our other offices in Nantes and Mauritius.\u201d\nThe physical installation of 14 indoor APs was facilitated by Meraki\u2019s rapid installation design and network configuration took 15 minutes. \u201cWhat is interesting is that we were able to prepare the configuration on the dashboard even before the access points were turned on,\u201d Morel said. \u201cUpon connection, the access points automatically connected to the cloud and retrieved their configuration settings.\u201d\nAt the Linkbynet head office, Morel configured three SSIDs. Employees connect to a dedicated SSID, authenticating with 802.1X integrated with Linkbynet\u2019s Active Directory. Guests connect to an isolated SSID, with temporary logins, which are created by reception using a Guest Ambassador account in the dashboard. Finally, Linkbynet configured a third SSID secured with WPA2-PSK for Make-A-Wish-France, an association that the company hosts on their premises. By segmenting users into these three SSIDs and applying appropriate security policies for each, Linkbynet significantly improved security without complicating the user experience.\nWith the rich visibility and simplicity of the Meraki dashboard, Morel is now able to produce regular reports about the usage of applications and monitor the overall health of the network. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few months since we started using the dashboard and it\u2019s nice to see that there are regular updates that add new features,\u201d he said. \u201cI am especially a fan of the \u2018make a wish\u2019 box at the bottom of each page on the dashboard where we can enter suggestions for additional features that we would like to see appear.\u201d\nOverall the Linkbynet users and staff are very happy with the Meraki network. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic! There is very little management required,\u201d Morel said. \u201cIf anything abnormal happens, Meraki automatically sends an email to let us know. Not to mention the monthly report on the use of infrastructure.\u201d"

With offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C., Clune transforms interior sites into beautiful and functional spaces where occupants thrive.\nBased at the Chicago headquarters, Eric Gardner, Director of IT, and his two team members are charged with maintaining the company\u2019s entire wireless network and providing comprehensive tech support for all offices and field locations in 22 states. Originally the network, which consisted of a mix of unmanaged legacy access points (APs) and commercial units, challenged the small team in day-to-day management. \u201cIt was difficult to manage, given the limited interface,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThe APs weren\u2019t reliable, and they weren\u2019t easy to update.\u201d\nMuch of Clune\u2019s business relies on iPads and mobile devices to mark up job site photos, manipulate drawings, and create 3-D models. Gardner needed a reliable wireless connection throughout the offices so employees and guests could move seamlessly throughout the network, accessing both personal and productivity applications. Upon hearing about Meraki from one of his technology partners, Gardner found the idea of cloud management appealing. He decided to trial the products and was immediately impressed by the Dashboard, security features, and the overall ease of use. \u201cI chose Meraki over other solutions because it was easier to configure and manage,\u201d Gardner said.\nThe initial deployment of Meraki\u2019s plug-and-play APs at the Los Angeles and Chicago offices took little time. \u201cIt was much faster than with a typical hardware WiFi controller,\u201d Gardner said. When the company opened two new offices, Gardner simply added the APs to his dashboard, and the network settings were automatically pushed to the devices. Then it was just a matter of sending the APs to the new locations, having someone plug them in, and the network was live. \u201cIt was, by far, the simplest thing I had to do in setting up technology at the offices.\u201d\nNow Clune\u2019s employees enjoy secure, robust network access across all sites, and can reliably transfer large project files between locations. Guests can also connect to the network \u2013 they log in via a click-through splash page, and are blocked from the LAN to maintain security. \u201cTo me, wireless is almost like a copier,\u201d Gardner explained. \u201cYou take it for granted; you just want it to work.\u201d\nBest of all, reliable WiFi supports Clune\u2019s Virtual Construction Department as they pioneer the use of Building Information Modeling for complex interior construction projects. Clune creates 3-D models of build sites before construction begins, providing virtual walk-throughs for clients and increasing efficiency during the building process.\nMeraki has taken something that used to be a headache and made it so simple, I don\u2019t think about it. I couldn\u2019t be happier with it!\n\nDirector of IT\nIn addition to the in-office wireless network, Clune uses Meraki WiFi at field sites where short-term mobile networks are often required. Because of the plug and play functionality of Meraki APs, employees at job sites can be securely connected to the main offices in a matter of minutes, transferring files, and staying constantly up-to-date on any project changes.\nAcross all the sites, Clune sees over 20 GB of data flowing across its network every week. Meanwhile, the in-depth reporting features and simple management allow Gardner the freedom to focus on other important tasks. \u201cThe less time I have to think about wireless, the more time I have to think about other things,\u201d says Gardner, like managing his team and ensuring they are able to provide the best possible service to Clune\u2019s employees and clients. \u201cMeraki has taken something that used to be a headache and made it so simple, I don\u2019t think about it. I couldn\u2019t be happier with it!\u201d"

    "text": "Lucas Clara knows the importance of wireless networks. As IT Director at Foster Pepper PLLC, a Seattle-based law firm with 260 employees, Clara has had wireless deployed across his organization for years.\nBut constant problems with the existing wireless network were negatively impacting his team\u2019s ability to juggle many different IT responsibilities, including wireless. On any given day, there was the constant stream of reliability and connectivity complaints from wireless users. Employees at the firm could not stay connected, and visitors at the firm could not log in. In addition, any configuration changes always seemed harder than they needed to be. For example, it was difficult to integrate the wireless network with the organization\u2019s RADIUS server, and installing or replacing APs always took longer than expected. \u201cAny little change took a week,\u201d said Clara.\nFinally, the pain the wireless network was inflicting reached a breaking point. Clara decided that a replacement was in order. The criteria for selecting a replacement were clear. At a high level, Clara wanted to ensure that the new system would provide reliable coverage and would be simple to deploy and manage, even by multiple administrators responsible for multiple remote offices. The solution also had to be cost-effective, with low up-front costs as well as low ongoing costs for maintenance and support.\nFrom a feature perspective, the solution needed to offer investment protection, so Clara wanted 802.11n access points with Gigabit Ethernet ports for the latest-and-greatest wireless performance available. Given the importance of security in a legal practice, the solution needed to support 802.1X for robust authentication and encryption. To enable guest wireless users to access the Internet while remaining isolated from sensitive internal data, multiple SSIDs with VLAN tagging support was desired. This capability would enable administrators to build different wireless networks for different departments or applications.\nAfter evaluating several systems, Clara concluded that Meraki was the clear choice. Clara deployed 20 Meraki access points in Foster Pepper\u2019s main office in Seattle, WA, and in a remote office in Spokane, WA. The entire deployment, including mounting the hardware and configuring the networks, took only 6 hours. In addition, no changes to client machines were required, which saved a significant amount of time and effort for Clara and his staff.\nUsing Meraki\u2019s support for multiple virtual isolated networks, Clara configured separate employee and guest networks that shared a single set of wireless access points and a single connection to the Internet. The employee network authenticated users via 802.1X, and provided secure connectivity to the Internet as well as to LAN resources such as printers and file shares. In contrast, the guest network was configured with a splash page, which required visitors to sign in on a web page before gaining Internet-only access. The guest network also blocked adult content using a content filtering feature that is integrated in the Meraki wireless solution. Traffic on the guest network was isolated from the secure employee network so that guests could neither access employee resources, nor infect employee\u2019s computers with viruses.\nSince the initial deployment, Foster Pepper has taken advantage of the ease of network expansion that Meraki\u2019s unique web-based central management provides. To deploy wireless in Foster Pepper\u2019s Spokane office, Clara simply sent out an access point to that office and asked someone there to plug it in. The access point automatically established a secure connection to the Meraki cloud, downloaded its configuration, and applied the appropriate settings \u2013 all without requiring any manual configuration or on-site IT.\nIn another instance, Clara needed to provide temporary network access in an ad-hoc space that was to be used for arbitration. Clara plugged in a Meraki access point, and in minutes, 15 firm employees and clients were online.\nWe have had an excellent experience with Meraki, from the sales process through the implementation, administration, and the end user experience\n\nIT Director\nClara declared the Meraki deployment a success in easing the burden on his IT administration. \u201cIt was plug and play, and there were no new complex systems to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other administrators have also been very happy with the reporting, alerting, and LACK of management overhead.\u201d\nEnthusiasm was not limited to Clara and his staff. \u201cOur wireless users have been extremely happy\u201d, he noted. With access points deployed in conference rooms, reception areas, and shared spaces, employees now regularly use wireless during meetings and when working away from their desks. On a typical day, a dozen visitors use the guest network to access the Internet and VPN back to their own offices.\n\u201cWe have had an excellent experience with Meraki,\u201d Clara concludes, \u201cfrom the sales process through the implementation, administration, and the end user experience.\u201d\nWe have had an excellent experience with Meraki, from the sales process through the implementation, administration, and the end user experience."

    "text": "Since its founding in 1935, the City College of San Francisco has flourished into one of the largest community colleges in the United States. With over 90,000 students across nine large campuses, the urban, multicultural academic institute embodies the diversity of the bay area. And as the enrollment numbers continue to increase at the multi-campus junior college, so do its networking needs.\nTim Ryan, who has been Manager of Technical Operations at CCSF for over 10 years, has witnessed a dramatic shift in students\u2019 demand for Internet access. \u201cAll of our campuses are connected by a fiber network that we share with the city, so teachers have had access for years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now WiFi can extend that access to students. Students want access in the libraries, they want to do research on their own devices. We want students to be able to take advantage of our high-speed network infrastructure.\u201d\nCCSF previously utilized a mix of wireless equipment from other vendors, but as students began bringing their own devices to campus and wireless demand increased, Ryan recognized that a solution refresh was necessary to handle peak traffic. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 50% growth in traffic over the past three years,\u201d he explained. Meanwhile, with only five IT staff focused on networking, Ryan needed a wireless solution that was easy to manage. \u201cEveryone here is doing multiple jobs. Support is a big challenge for us \u2013 we have to minimize our staff\u2019s time.\u201d\nRyan and his team chose Meraki cloud-managed wireless access points (APs) in response to CCSF\u2019s request for proposals. \u201cEveryone was impressed by the simplicity and the user interface for the cloud dashboard,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd we liked that we wouldn\u2019t have to maintain a hardware controller on-site. We saw that Meraki was easy to set up and easy to move around to meet our needs.\u201d\nCCSF was also working within a tight budget. \u201cMeraki was the most cost-effective solution,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe firmware upgrades are included, and there is no separate maintenance contract. This helps us to reduce costs while increasing service, so that we can be more tech-forward.\u201d\nDeploying Meraki APs across multiple campuses took only three weeks. Ryan prioritized wireless access in classrooms where teachers requested it and in public areas, such as the library, cafeteria, and lobby, to facilitate independent study. \u201cWith so many students bringing their own devices to campus, we want to respond to academic need as well as the independent study and entertainment aspect,\u201d he explained. He also placed APs in centrally-located telephone closets that already housed his Ethernet hardware. Deployment was simplified by pre-populating APs in the web-based Meraki dashboard; when the devices were installed they automatically authenticated and downloaded their configuration from the cloud.\nMeraki was the most cost-effective solution. The firmware upgrades are included, and there is no separate maintenance contract. This helps us to reduce costs while increasing service, so that we can be more tech-forward.\nManager of Technical Operations\nTo make it easy for the students to get online securely and minimize support incidents, Ryan utilized Meraki\u2019s native Active Directory integration, enabling students to authenticate against CCSF\u2019s AD environment via a splash page. Meanwhile, Meraki\u2019s built-in firewall prevents unwanted wireless access to secure network resources. For special events like football games and career fairs, Ryan creates a temporary SSID that does not require authentication. \u201cWe really like the flexibility and adaptability of Meraki to meet our needs,\u201d Ryan said.\nNow Ryan\u2019s small IT Team supports thousands of clients who often transfer over 100 GB each day. \u201cThe cloud management is saving us a lot of time,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBefore, we had to apply patches to the controller, and now we are free from that. The APs are very reliable. We get email alerts if anything goes down or there is a configuration change.\u201d\nThe Meraki dashboard also provides much-needed visibility into the network. \u201cOur staff is so small, and our users so spread out, we don\u2019t have a help desk,\u201d Ryan explained. \u201cWe rely on the dashboard to evaluate user experience \u2013 the number of simultaneous users gives us an idea of scale and demand for wireless.\u201d\nNaturally, demand is rising. Although City College has more than 70 computer labs with over 2000 computers, it still struggles with a shortage of devices. \u201cSometimes there are only 30 wired computers in a lab, so if 10 students can bring laptops we can support everyone,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan also utilizes laptops on carts for new-student orientation and is offering these carts for classroom use as well. \u201cIt takes a lot of infrastructure to put in a new lab \u2013 it\u2019s pretty expensive. If we can provide lab instruction using laptops in a traditional classroom, we can support more users.\u201d Ryan also noted that, because Meraki\u2019s cloud architecture does not have the artificial limits of a traditional controller, new APs can always be added; many departments now buy their own Meraki APs and add them to the network.\nRyan says he is always looking for new ways to incorporate WiFi into learning environments. \u201cWe see a lot of streaming content and YouTube, but we\u2019re also shifting to online classes, and we use web applications like Blackboard and Gmail and Moodle for everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m interested to see how teachers change their instruction style to incorporate wireless. At CCSF, we\u2019re trying to serve every neighborhood and teach every class, so it\u2019s a very dynamic environment. I expect there will be a variety of best practices.\u201d"

    "text": "The Monterey Jazz Festival is the longest continuously running jazz festival in the world. Since its start in 1958, the Festival has been held on the 20-acre Monterey County Fairgrounds, and this year was no different. Encircled by large oak trees, the venue hosted 38,000 attendees who saw over 500 artists perform on eight stages. Besides featuring world-renowned jazz musicians like Tony Bennett, Trombone Shorty, and 2011 GRAMMY\u00ae award winner Esperanza Spalding, the Monterey Jazz Festival wanted to provide event WiFi.\n\u201cA lot of attendees bring iPads and mobile devices to the festival,\u201d said Kimberly Knight, Marketing Director for Monterey Jazz Festival. \u201cWith our Monterey Jazz Festival App for iPhone and Android devices, we wanted to have free WiFi so that everyone can use their technology at the Festival.\u201d\nAlvarez Technology Group (ATG) was contracted to deploy and manage the free high-speed wireless across the expansive, heavily wooded fairgrounds. Curtis Thomas, Director of Managed Services at ATG, recognized that wireless reliability would be key when he learned that Yamaha\u2019s Disklavier RemoteLive technology was to be incorporated into some of the Monterey Jazz Festival performances. RemoteLive allows a pianist to transmit, in real time over the Internet, his or her precise keystrokes and pedal activities to other networked Disklavier pianos. The WiFi network allowed the piano to be conveniently moved around the stage without worrying about Ethernet cabling.\nFrom the beginning of the day when there were only 10-15 users to later in the day with hundreds upon hundreds, there was no real change. Meraki is unmatched.\n\nDirector of Managed Services\nIn order to flawlessly showcase pianist/singer Judy Roberts on her Yamaha AvantGrand piano, and support thousands of visitors carrying mobile devices, choosing to deploy high performance Meraki access points was a \u201cno brainer,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested other solutions, but we\u2019ve consistently had the most success with Meraki. Other equipment we\u2019d tried in the past didn\u2019t have coverage in half the areas we needed them to.\u201d\nAlvarez Technology Group combined a mix of high-performing indoor Meraki MR16 access points with outdoor Meraki MR58 and MR66 APs to ensure superior coverage across all eight stages. \u201cWe went with the MR58 because it is more robust and we could just leave it outside,\u201d Thomas said.\nWith a few mouse clicks in the Meraki dashboard, Thomas set up four separate SSIDs including a private network for Monterey Jazz Festival staff and performers, two ticketing systems, and the free public network for attendees, which ATG throttled down to protect bandwidth. Thomas was particularly thrilled by the ease of deployment enabled by cloud management. \u201cThat is one of Meraki\u2019s biggest selling points,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cNot having to configure every access point just makes it easier and saves us so much time.\u201d\nKimberly Knight also felt reassured that ATG was deploying Meraki. \u201cWe had folks who were concerned about WiFi for this year\u2019s event and with Meraki on board, I could tell them with full confidence that our WiFi would be better than ever,\u201d she said.\nOver the Festival\u2019s three days, the wireless network transferred over 70 GB of total data to over 2,000 clients, with 50% of the data on the guest network alone. \u201cEven in a high density situation, Meraki had no problem handling the number of users,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cFrom the beginning of the day when there were only 10-15 users to later in the day with hundreds upon hundreds, there was no real change. Meraki is unmatched.\u201d\nThe Monterey Jazz Festival\u2019s WiFi allowed attendees to use iPads and other mobile devices to watch the live stream of the festival, access apps, check email, tweet, and upload photos and videos of performances via their phones. The Festival\u2019s organizers were also able to promote the 2012 Monterey Jazz Festival application for iOS and Android devices, which allowed users to check performance schedules, view a map of the fairgrounds, study food vendors\u2019 menus, and explore available arts and crafts offerings. Over 1,400 users downloaded the Monterey Jazz Festival Application over the course of the weekend.\nWhile festivalgoers celebrated the legacy of jazz, the Alvarez Team celebrated a smooth network deployment. \u201cEverything worked the way it was supposed to work,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cTruthfully, the Meraki system was seamless.\u201d"

With headquarters in Palo Alto, California and four branch offices in California and Washington, Essex now manages over 160 apartment buildings.\nIn addition to the corporate offices, each of Essex\u2019s apartment buildings includes a leasing office with a few employees. Matt Clark, Director of IT for Essex, heads up the IT team that manages the servers, networking needs, and helpdesk support across all of these locations. Seeking better centralized management and security, Clark investigated firewall solutions from Watchguard and Sonicwall, as well as Meraki\u2019s MX Security Appliances.\n\u201cMeraki\u2019s management interface won us over quickly,\u201d Clark said. \u201cNone of the other solutions offered such easy setup and management. With Meraki, the centralized management, security, and site-to-site VPN worked right\nout of the box.\u201d\nClark deployed 180 Meraki MXs\u2014one per office, as well as 170 Meraki MR wireless APs, thus providing corporate-sanctioned wireless across all sites. Essex also placed Meraki MS switches in the corporate offices.\n\u201cDeployment was very quick and easy,\u201d Clark said. He added the serial numbers and network addresses to the web-based Meraki dashboard in advance. \u201cThen we just had someone unplug the Netgear and plug in the MX and the AP, and that was pretty much it!\u201d\nWith a few clicks in the dashboard, Clark created a guest wireless network using Meraki DHCP\u2014completely segregated from the Essex Corporate wireless network, which is secured with Active Directory authentication. Meraki\u2019s stateful firewall securely directs guest traffic to the Internet while preventing guests from accessing the LAN. \u201cWe also get warnings now if someone plugs in a rogue AP,\u201d Clark said.\nPreviously, offices relied on Citrix for remote access of centralized data. Now, Essex\u2019s remote sites access resources from headquarters with a seamless, zero-configuration site-to-site VPN. \u201cMeraki deals with all\nVPN tunnels and encryption keys seamlessly\u2014no one else can do that,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt looked like it would be easy to set up, and then it actually was.

    "text": "On top of Salt Pond Mountain, deep in the deciduous hardwood forest of the Appalachian Mountains in southwestern Virginia, the Mountain Lake Biological Station is the field research center for the University of Virginia\u2019s Biology Department. Every summer 60-80 researchers, faculty, and students live and work at the station, conducting research in areas such as plant and animal population biology, behavioral ecology, conservation biology, or ecological genetics.\nWhile the fine-scale changes in habitat at this remote mountaintop location make it ideal for studying ecology and evolution, the thick oak tree canopy, frequent rain and fog, windy conditions, and single T1 line into the station make it a wireless networking super-challenge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely opaque situation,\u201d said Dr. Eric Nagy, Associate Director of the Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS). \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set up a wireless network in a forest, but the signal doesn\u2019t go through trees well. We\u2019ve got no line of sight between the points we\u2019re trying to connect, because 20 trees are in the way. And there\u2019s a lot of water, and wireless signals hate water.\u201d\nThe Mountain Lake Biological Station was built in 1929 and hasn\u2019t changed much since then. It includes two large laboratories and 29 small residential buildings. Ten years ago, the two laboratories were retrofitted with Ethernet cables and switches, and a T1 line connected MLBS to the outside world. Still, researchers could only access the internet from the computer lab, and they weren\u2019t happy about it.\nNagy, who describes himself as \u201cthe de facto IT guy\u201d for the minimally-staffed biological station, explained that the MLBS buildings have only two public telephones and no cell phone service, so internet provides the best means for students and researchers from all over the country to talk to their families.\n\u201cNot having wireless was a horrible problem,\u201d he said. \u201cStudents want to be online all the time, even while they sleep. Everybody\u2019s working hard, taking classes, moving in and out of lab space\u2014and meanwhile people want to be able to sit in their cabins and check their email or do their work. The lack of wireless was a huge constraint to being able to work and be happy at Mountain Lake.\u201d\nNagy wanted to set up a wireless network that would provide coverage to the residential buildings without installing new wired infrastructure. He began by experimenting with strategically-placed small access points from Buffalo Technology, starting with a gateway connection from the wired laboratory and little by little extending the network, but the signal was blocked by trees and closely positioned buildings. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t cutting it,\u201d he said.\nA colleague from another research field station recommended exploring solutions from Meraki. The range and rugged outdoor specs of the MR58 access points (APs) presented a feasible option for extending WiFi coverage, and Nagy worked with Meraki engineers to develop the optimal configuration. \u2018I knew where we needed coverage, and we all looked at the same map and talked on the phone about where the devices might go,\u2019 Nagy said.\nHe then mounted the MR58s outside on metal fence posts about five feet off the ground\u2014well below the leaf canopy. Most of the APs were powered by Power over Ethernet. \u201cThey really are plug-and-play,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cI set them up, exchanged some antennas, and adjusted their position to get the best line of sight through the trees.\u201d\nNagy deployed four triple-radio MR58 APs in conjunction with five Meraki indoor APs, altogether forming a roughly pentagonal-shaped mesh network over 500 feet across, straight through the heart of Jefferson National Forest. \u201cAgain, this is such a demanding environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this were an open area without trees, one MR58 would have done the trick.\u201d Carefully positioned panel directional antennas as well as omnidirectional antennas maximize the communication signal between the repeaters and the gateway unit.\nNow nearly all of MLBS\u2019s residential buildings (and even some research plots in the woods) have wireless coverage, and researchers are able to use their laptops to access the internet as well as LAN network resources like printers. At peak summer usage, MLBS residents transferred over 135 GB/month over the network.\nMeraki\u2019s remote management and troubleshooting is hugely valuable.\n\nAssociate Director\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge work benefit,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cPeople can use their own laptops in their cabins instead of trying to use the computer lab, and they are really thrilled.\u201d Nagy noted that the decreased computer lab usage also reduced maintenance work for him.\nThe remote setting of Mountain Lake Biological Station continues to present unique challenges, but Meraki\u2019s self-healing access points and central management through the Enterprise Cloud Controller effectively minimize Nagy\u2019s headaches. \u201cWe\u2019ve only got one power line to the station, and we get a lot of power outages,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, during a serious storm sometimes an AP will lose connectivity, which changes the mesh structure that the signal follows. It\u2019s really demanding on the units, and they\u2019re doing a good job. I\u2019m not there all the time, so the network has to be self-healing to be successful.\u201d\nNagy not only uses the Meraki Dashboard to troubleshoot the network when he\u2019s working from the University of Virginia main campus, he also uses it to monitor client traffic and restrict bandwidth when the station is crowded in the summer. \u201cThat kind of control is very useful, to be able to see where the traffic is going and manage that from onsite or offsite,\u201d he said. \u201cMeraki\u2019s remote management and troubleshooting is hugely valuable. Overall, the system is doing everything it promised, and it\u2019s working great.\u201d\nMeraki\u2019s remote management and troubleshooting is hugely valuable."

    "text": "At the distribution warehouse of the apparel company Cutter & Buck, wireless sewing machine robots embroider logos and patterns onto jackets and shirts. These sewing robots work up to 20 hours each day, downloading the logos from a server over the wireless network, auto feeding the color, and then stitching the patterns. Spread across the 350 square foot warehouse, the robots are too far from a switch to be wired in.\nCutter & Buck started using this system three years ago with a legacy wireless network deployed at the distribution warehouse in Renton, Washington, as well as at corporate headquarters in Seattle and at the New York showroom.\n\u201cThe wireless was a pain to manage,\u201d said Dean Dunlop, Cutter & Buck\u2019s Network Analyst. \u201cThe VPNs always had a problem, and it was generally for the most important people like the CEO or CFO. The helpdesk was getting hammered. It was hard just to keep the system up and running. We were always doing upgrades, and at least once a month we were driving down to the distribution center, about an hour away from our headquarters, to fix the access points there or manage the updates.\u201d\nFrustrated with the complex and time-consuming solution, Dunlop wanted an alternative solution that was easy to deploy and manage. \u201cI didn\u2019t want our help desk guys supporting the wireless all the time. They have a lot of other things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the wireless goes down, it\u2019s always an emergency.\u201d\nDunlop also wanted a better system for guest access. \u201cWe had a shared username and password for all the guests,\u201d Dunlop explained. \u201cOnce people knew it, they could go downstairs from our corporate office and sit in Starbucks and use the wireless all the time. We had bandwidth issues on our guest network even when we had nobody in the building.\u201d\nDunlop learned about Meraki\u2019s cloud-based solution from Softchoice Corporation, a Meraki partner. \u201cWe saw the demo, and our reaction was \u2018holy smokes, that is so cool, we\u2019d love to try it.\u2019 And I\u2019m so glad we did.\u201d Deployment took about four hours, compared to the 20 days Dunlop remembers spending configuring the original solution. He plans to deploy two more Meraki APs at the new showroom in New York, which will be completely wireless for aesthetic reasons.\nBefore Meraki, Cutter & Buck managed a series of complex, somewhat separate wireless networks spread out across multiple sites. The networks relied on a series of VPN connections to ensure proper access back to internal resources at corporate headquarters, while providing appropriate levels of wireless security. Using Lobby Ambassador, Meraki\u2019s built-in guest management system, Cutter & Buck\u2019s receptionists now create temporary customized guest user IDs and passwords. Additionally, Meraki now helps to filter and shape content on the trusted side to comply with corporate policy, while being a bit more lenient with wireless guest traffic for visitors\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal devices.\nDunlop taught Cutter & Buck\u2019s receptionists how to create temporary customized guest user IDs and passwords. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy, they love it,\u201d he said. \u201cNot dealing with guest access anymore took a lot of weight off the helpdesk and my team.\u201d\nDunlop delivers enthusiastic praise for Meraki. First, he appreciates the lack of on-site controller, noting the $7,000 he spent on each of his original WAP controllers. Second, he loves that maintenance and support are included in the Meraki product.\nI pulled out the last legacy AP the other day, and it feels awesome. We\u2019re 100% pleased with Meraki. Everything it\u2019s supposed to do, it does.\n\nNetwork Analyst\n\u201cThe Meraki help desk is awesome,\u201d Dunlop said. \u201cThey really know what they\u2019re doing, so I don\u2019t have to talk to three tiers of support. I\u2019m on the phone five minutes, I get my answer, and I\u2019m good to go. With the other guys I used to be on the phone for two hours.\u201d\nWhile Dunlop\u2019s total cost of ownership is far lower with Meraki than it was with his original solution, he says Meraki\u2019s ease of use is an even greater benefit. \u201cEasy\u2019s not even the right word \u2014 it\u2019s just a great experience,\u201d he said. \u201cOur philosophy is, we should build it once and let it run. We don\u2019t have to manage it. It emails us if there\u2019s a problem. And our employees and guests love it \u2014 it just works.\u201d\nDunlop says he just wishes he\u2019d started with Meraki three years ago. \u201cI pulled out the last legacy AP the other day, and it feels awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re 100% pleased with Meraki.

    "text": "\u201cProviding our students with more wireless services is our number one priority here,\u201d says Donald Beck, Director of Information Technology Systems at Davidson County Community College. With over 4,000 curriculum students and 10,000 continuing education students spread across campuses throughout Davidson and Davie Counties in North Carolina, providing reliable and continuous wireless coverage seemed daunting.\n\u201cGiving students the ability to bring their devices to campus is something that other universities have already dealt with and may take for granted, but this is new for community colleges and is very immediate,\u201d Beck explained.\nDavidson\u2019s legacy three-controller network provided some options for network control, but failed to offer visibility into the network or to provide other critical features with such simplified management, such as RADIUS authentication and bandwidth shaping. The nine members of the Davidson IT team \u2014 two dedicated to network management \u2014 couldn\u2019t keep up with the complexity of the prior architecture, particularly with having to apply configuration and firmware updates and then hire consultants to test the changes. With an initiative to move to a laptop or BYOD campus imminent in the coming months, Beck knew it was time for a change.\nThe goal at Davidson was to simplify management so that they could provide more services for the students and expand the network to meet the growing wireless demand on campus. Beck and network administrator Rick Schwendiman researched a variety of traditional solutions, but after visiting a 4 year college that had deployed Meraki\u2019s cloud-managed solution and viewing the setup first-hand, he felt most confident about Meraki.\n\u201cWe could see how little management it took to run the network, and the students were walking around the campus with mobile devices seamlessly and without any network drops,\u201d he said.\nMeraki\u2019s cloud architecture eliminates the expense of a traditional hardware controller, simultaneously enabling a single network administrator to control access points at all locations via a web-based dashboard. \u201cCost and management-wise, nothing else that we looked at compared with Meraki,\u201d Beck said. Meanwhile, he was particularly excited about Meraki\u2019s capacity for meshing, automatic optimization, and seamless roaming from one part of campus to another.\nBeck and his team installed over 75 access points (APs) on the Davidson main campus and three offsite campuses. The entire deployment was completed in a matter of hours. \u201cIt took more time to climb the ladder than to make the network work,\u201d Beck laughed.\nCoverage immediately increased by 50%, resulting in a need for fewer APs compared to Davidson\u2019s previous solution. Davidson was also able to provide wireless to remote buildings that had been unreachable with the previous network.\nThe new Meraki network permits students and faculty to be increasingly mobile both in the classroom as well as throughout the campus. Beck maintains security on the network by utilizing multiple SSIDs and providing access to students and staff using 802.1X RADIUS authentication and to guests through a click-through splash page. With the deep visibility and real time tools that Meraki provides, Davidson County Community College\u2019s IT staff are able to see current statistics of users and applications on the network and quickly make changes to allow or deny certain traffic or groups of users. \u201cThis is huge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can manage the entire system from anywhere, without being limited by boundaries.\u201d\nIn terms of management and cost, nothing else that we looked at compared to Meraki.\n\nDirector of ITS\nThe elasticity of the network also enables the quick creation of learning spaces. \u201cWe had a lab that we needed to put in place quickly and get laptops connected fast,\u201d Beck said. \u201cInstead of running network drops, we just plugged in APs and were able to provide immediate access,\u201d explained Beck. Because Meraki utilizes plug-and-play access points and mesh technology, it\u2019s simple to create these pop-up learning environments and add more coverage if needed.\nIn a recent campus poll, 90% of Davidson\u2019s students reported bringing at least one mobile device on campus with them. Meraki\u2019s client fingerprinting enables Beck to see all of these devices and create device-based bandwidth policies; meanwhile, layer-7 application traffic shaping rules make it easy to limit applications on the devices if they are undesirable or use too much bandwidth. Beck also limits the bandwidth on the guest network. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to do that before,\u201d he said.\nNot only is Davidson able to provide more extensive wireless coverage for students, but the simplified management allows the IT team to take a step back and work on other important projects. Beck jests, \u201cIf we ever went back to another network system, our network admin would probably refuse to manage it!\u201d\nDavidson County Community College expands network to support BYOD initiative and pop-up learning spaces"

    "text": "Non-profit organization Mosaic provides services such as job coaching, case management, life skills building, special education, and supported living to more than 3,500 people with intellectual disabilities. Headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, Mosaic employs 5,000+ people across 38 agencies in 11 states. Most employees work in regional offices and visit clients in their own homes, group homes, and apartments.\nMosaic wanted to create a secure, HIPAA-compliant wide area network (WAN) between the many branches and the headquarters, enabling executive staff and nurses to easily access the electronic health records, medication dosage information, time keeping portals, and human resources solutions that are stored in Omaha.\nAt the same time, the need for wireless access to support the extremely mobile staff had become painfully clear: despite the policy against wireless prescribed from headquarters, numerous agencies deployed their own off the shelf products and called the Omaha-based IT helpline when things went wrong.\n\u201cThe whole network was a nightmare to manage,\u201d said Daniel McDonald, Mosaic\u2019s Systems Integration Manager. \u201cWe don\u2019t have IT in the field, but meanwhile we house all our data here at headquarters, so that was a challenge.\u201d McDonald longed to connect Mosaic\u2019s nearly 40 sites through a secure site-to-site VPN, deploy centrally-managed wireless everywhere, and provide mobile tablets to all employees. everyone.\nMPLS seemed like a possible solution, but it was well outside the budget for the non-profit organization. Then McDonald learned about Cisco Meraki gateway devices and wireless access points (APs). \u201cI was floored by how easy it was to take care of everything through the cloud-based dashboard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a certified engineer to operate it. We saw right away that it would be much easier to deploy Meraki hardware everywhere and manage it all from here.\u201d\nWith a small IT team, Mosaic deployed over 300 Cisco Meraki 802.11n APs and 40 Meraki MX gateways \u2013 all connected through site-to-site VPN \u2013 in Mosaic\u2019s remote locations nationwide. \u201cThe Meraki solution has provided us with a secure, centrally managed distributed network without the cost of MPLS,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cOur users love having reliable wireless, and the network is easy for us to manage. The upgrade has been really exciting for us.\u201d\nTo add a branch into Mosaic\u2019s new network architecture, all McDonald has to do is log in to the web-based Meraki dashboard, add an MX gateway into the organization, and enable the VPN with a single mouse click. MX gateways automatically discover each other through the Cisco Meraki cloud, so there is no need to manually create routes between each. The network automatically monitors VPN connectivity and adjusts to any real-time changes. The complexity of traditional site-to-site VPN settings \u2013 such as configuring IPsec authentication, security association parameters, and key exchanges \u2013 are completely automated by the Meraki cloud.\nThe Cisco Meraki solution has provided us with a secure, centrally managed distributed network without the cost of MPLS. The upgrade has been really exciting for us.\n\nSystems Integration Manager\nMcDonald said Mosaic\u2019s new VPN connectivity has had a significant impact on helpdesk support, as the team can now proactively monitor and troubleshoot all the remote sites, as well as easily SSH into computers in the field. Further, the site-to-site VPN enabled print servers which dramatically improved the speed and quality when printing documents hosted on Mosaic\u2019s private cloud at headquarters.\n\u201c75% of our troubleshooting issues were with printing,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cMeraki takes the confusion out of everything.\u201d\nWith the nationwide deployment of Cisco Meraki 802.11n wireless APs, Mosaic\u2019s employees now enjoy always-on mobile connectivity. They authenticate to the network through 802.1X/RADIUS and then can securely access electronic medical records from headquarters, maintaining HIPAA compliance. Meanwhile, Mosaic\u2019s IT staff can see the status of every access point through the Meraki dashboard. Client fingerprinting provides them with insight into the types of mobile devices on the Mosaic network, and Layer 7 Application Traffic Shaping enables them to limit P2P traffic and prioritize bandwidth by application.\nTo support the growing demand of devices on Mosaic\u2019s network, McDonald deployed over 70 new Cisco Meraki MR18 access points. \u201cWith the new MR18 access points, Meraki continued to provide us with an unprecedented ease-of-use, matched with a new level of RF visibility,\u201d said McDonald. These newly released APs provide reliable and robust connectivity in high density environments where employees are connecting more and more devices, while also providing enhanced security via a built-in third radio on each AP. The dedicated security radio plays a huge role in providing visibility in the RF environment, optimizing RF configuration, and mitigating wireless threats.\n\u201cThe Cisco Meraki team is incredibly responsive and is always adding useful new features to the dashboard,\u201d McDonald said. He is also pleased with how firmware updates push to his Meraki devices automatically. \u201cI cross firmware updates off my to-do list without even thinking about it.\u201d\nWhen Mosaic tackled a VoIP solution for several key buildings, McDonald again turned to Cisco Meraki. \u201cThe project required a switch refresh, and I already trusted Meraki after my experience with the other products,\u201d he explained. \u201cMeraki\u2019s switches were more affordable, easier to deploy, and offer better metrics and network visibility. Now I can support more people and devices.\u201d"

    "text": "When Ed Sharp joined Century Care Management two years ago, one of the first things he wanted to address was wireless internet access. \u201cWe needed to join the 21st century,\u201d he said. \u201cWe finally got serious about it this year.\u201d\nCentury Care Management, a skilled nursing management company based in Cary, North Carolina, manages eight nursing homes across North Carolina. These facilities offer both short-term and long-term care and rehabilitation, with the smallest facility containing 80 beds and the largest featuring 140. Century Care employs over 400 clinical and 15 corporate staff members.\nCentury Care originally had one consumer-grade wireless access point (AP) at each facility and at headquarters, but these APs had limited range and could only be used by Century Care\u2019s internal staff. \u201cIt was very much a stopgap measure,\u201d said Sharp, Director of Support Services.\nMeanwhile, multiple constituents desired internet access. \u201cThe visiting doctors brought in laptops when seeing residents, and they wanted to use the laptop-based clinical software from their hospitals,\u201d Sharp explained. \u201cOur residents wanted to connect to the outside world using wireless. And our staff couldn\u2019t use their laptops everywhere in the building\u2014they had to be near the access point.\u201d Visiting pharmacists and state inspectors wanted access as well. \u201cEverybody was feeling the pain. We knew we needed to take a long-term strategic look at how we provide wireless services in our company,\u201d Sharp said.\nThe wired network infrastructure was already in place. Each of Century Care\u2019s eight nursing home facilities has a business-class ISP link for public and private traffic. The connection to headquarters runs through a site-to-site VPN network (a hub-and-spoke architecture). Legacy routing and switching infrastructure manages traffic at each location.\nTo smooth the transition to network-wide wireless, Century Care worked with value-added reseller Eproach to find a cost-effective, easy to manage solution. \u201cWe\u2019re a very lean and mean company,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of technology resources to provide support or care and feeding for any solution we put in, so whatever we did, we knew it had to be easy to take care of long term.\u201d\nIn addition, Sharp knew he needed to be able to separate public versus private traffic in order to maintain the security of corporate and patient data. \u201cHIPAA compliance was tantamount to any consideration we had,\u201d he said.\nAfter evaluating wireless solutions from Meru and Meraki, Sharp said it was Meraki\u2019s cloud-based model with the dashboard that swayed him. \u201cI was attracted to the idea that I don\u2019t need to host anything or have any servers here,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, I can access everything from one simple, web-based dashboard, and that makes for a very clean, easy-to-manage solution.\u201d\nCentury Care deployed 75 Meraki MR14 dual-radio 802.11n APs across its eight nursing home facilities and its headquarters. Eproach installed the APs using a phased approach, focusing on one location for a day or two each week. \u201cIt was pretty quick,\u2019 Sharp said. \u201cThe implementation was totally painless from our perspective.\u201d\nHe still remembers when the first set of APs came online. \u201cEproach called when the first site was done and gave me the username and password,\u201d he said. \u201cI jumped into the dashboard and bang, I could see the site and the APs. The dashboard was so intuitive and easy to use, I started using the features and making changes to the environment right away.\u201d\nThe dashboard was so intuitive and easy to use, I started using the features and making changes to the environment right away\n\nDirector of Support Services\nIt was key for Century Care staffers to be able to travel between sites, power on their laptops, and automatically authenticate to each network seamlessly. A WPA2 encrypted SSID, available at each site, allowed each staffer to authenticate with a single shared key. As a result, employees have instant, secure, and HIPAA-compliant access back to headquarters from any one of the eight sites they visit. All of the monitoring data from each site is presented to Sharp in a single view in the Meraki dashboard.\nSharp also created a unique public-access SSID for each facility so that guests would recognize their facility\u2019s name when selecting a network. Visiting caregivers, residents, and guests click through a Meraki-hosted splash page to access these public networks, while Meraki\u2019s built-in firewall keeps guest traffic separated from Century Care\u2019s corporate network. Unlike employee traffic, which travels back to headquarters over a VPN tunnel, guest traffic is configured to travel directly to its destination over the internet, minimizing traffic over the VPN tunnel to business-critical data only.\nSo far, Sharp said, both caregivers and residents have been happy with the new wireless. Some residents have even bought laptops to take advantage of it.\nAs for Sharp, he reported that the Meraki implementation gives him confidence. \u2018We need solid wireless infrastructure to support the new clinical software we expect to install next year, and we believe Meraki can do that for us,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ve had no downtime at all. There have been no surprises except good surprises, like performance enhancements. Everything we\u2019ve seen has been positive. I would unequivocally recommend this product.\u2019\nThe dashboard was so intuitive and easy to use, I started using the features and making changes to the environment right away."

    "text": "Patrick Garrett had a big problem. He wanted to deploy an enterprise-class network across a 20-acre steel manufacturing facility that was decidedly unfriendly to electronics. Between the massive quantities of signal-reflecting steel, the violent vibrations created by the machinery, and the extremely high EMI signature emitted by the 50 industrial welders on-site, every integrator Garrett turned to took one look and said, \u201cGood luck.\u201d\nLeft to his own devices, Garrett cobbled together a network using Tranzeo and Ubiquity equipment, cannibalizing access points and even deploying one on a golf cart to propagate his signal around the outdoor steel yard. The result was slow, unreliable, and time-consuming to maintain. \u201cManaging those networks was a logistical nightmare,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt worked, but it was neither easy to maintain nor elegant in design,\u201d he said. Seeking a better solution, he approached four different integrators with his vision of a network that worked both indoors and out, allowing employees to manage inventory and load lists for the shipments of steel plates and I-beams leaving the facility each day. They all said it was impossible.\n\u201cI tended to disagree,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. I considered our CEO\u2019s vision that we can get where we want to go using technology, and set out to find the better mousetrap.\u201d He started considering mesh as a strategy for propagating his signal around the interference.\nEnter Meraki. Garrett had come across Meraki in a trade magazine, in an article about the company\u2019s award-winning mesh technology. \u201cI was impressed by their willingness to go out there and put their equipment on the line to prove that it works. You know, show me, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d\nPersuaded, Garrett ordered seven Meraki access points, but he admits his expectations were low after months of disappointments with other vendors. \u201cI was poking sticks at them as I tried them out, and they kept coming through. I understood that building an outdoor network in a sea of steel was a huge challenge,\u201d he said. What happened with Meraki was a revelation.\n\u201cEveryone told me that if you want to push a signal further; put a bigger antenna on it. But Meraki is a complete paradigm shift to traditional wisdom on building a wireless network,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThe Meraki access point actually exploited the reflection of the steel and turned the building itself into a giant antenna!\u201d\nGarrett uses Meraki\u2019s cloud-based management and employs two SSIDs at his company, one for guests and partners, the other for employees. He says it is refreshing to have a network that plays well with all of the PCs, Macs, and UNIX machines onsite, and is self-healing when issues arise. \u201cWe have radios go down because of the level of EMI in the shop. Before Meraki, I would have to spend a day getting the network back up. With Meraki, I can just go to the Dashboard, and it\u2019s resolved. Meanwhile, the signal is never lost. Management of this is a no-brainer.\u201d That\u2019s good since Garrett and one part-time assistant are the entire IT department.\nBetter yet, the Meraki equipment has proven tough enough to stand up to the conditions inside and outside the plant. \u201cMost equipment we looked at [from other vendors] that was rugged enough, was exorbitantly expensive.\u201d We create a lot of metal dust and vibration that disturbs the electronics. Only Meraki has proven rugged enough.\u201d\nIt just works, it\u2019s an affordable solution, and it\u2019s easy to manage. Simple as that. I would recommend Meraki highly.\n\nTechnology Specialist\nThat it simply worked was a selling point, but not the only one. \u201cI have two internal metrics when I consider investing in equipment,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cOne, does it work? Two, can we pass the same traffic on it as we would pass through the wired network? The answer with Meraki was yes and yes.\u201d\nNow, Garrett is looking to use his Meraki network to implement a wireless inventory barcode scanning system. \u201cWe want to be on par with UPS,\u201d he said. Using 802.11 and Bluetooth, he expects to bring the entire operation onto the network soon.\n\u201cThis has been a very fruitful partnership for us. I know that Meraki is always working on fixing any issue before I even think of it, and constantly improving the product. I can\u2019t say the same about any other company. I would recommend Meraki highly,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIt just works, it\u2019s an affordable solution, and it\u2019s easy to manage. Simple as that.\u201d\nIt just works, it\u2019s an affordable solution, and it\u2019s easy to manage. Simple as that. I would recommend Meraki highly."
